## C2C Marketplace

A **C2C (Customer-to-Customer) Marketplace** is a marketplace model where **customers can become sellers** and list products for sale to other customers. Instead of only vendors selling on the platform, this model allows registered customers to easily convert into sellers and start selling products directly.

In a traditional multivendor environment, only designated vendors or sellers can list and sell products. With C2C capabilities, marketplaces can expand their user base and increase product variety by enabling **individual users to sell used, handmade, or second-hand products** as well.

## Why C2C Marketplace Is Valuable

The C2C marketplace model has several advantages for marketplace owners:

### Expanded Product Catalog
Allowing customers to list their own products increases the overall product variety available on the marketplace without onboarding traditional vendors.

### Increased Engagement
Customers become more engaged with the platform when they can also participate as sellers, leading to longer retention and higher activity levels.

### Monetization Opportunities
Marketplace owners can earn commissions or fees from customer sellers, just like normal vendors.

### Utilization of Existing Network
Existing customers who have products to sell can join the marketplace without needing a separate vendor onboarding process, making marketplace growth faster and friction-free.

## C2C Support in the Marketplace App

To support the Customer-to-Customer (C2C) use case, the Marketplace app includes a **C2C configuration feature** that allows customers to register as sellers and list products.

This feature empowers marketplace owners to transform regular customers into active sellers without relying only on traditional vendors.
