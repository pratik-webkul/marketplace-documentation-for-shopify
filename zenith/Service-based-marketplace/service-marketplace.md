Service-Based Marketplace
----------------------
A **Service-Based Marketplace** is a platform where sellers offer services instead of physical products. Customers can book these services for a specific date and time directly from the marketplace.

Using the **Marketplace app**, marketplace owners can create a multivendor service marketplace where multiple service providers can onboard and offer their services through a single platform.

Service-based marketplaces are widely adopted by businesses that provide time-bound or appointment-based services.



Common Use Cases for Service-Based Marketplaces
-----------------------
A service-based marketplace can support various business models, including:

- Professional service providers  
- On-demand service platforms  
- Local service marketplaces  
- Appointment-based service offerings  

This model allows customers to schedule services in advance while enabling sellers to manage their availability efficiently.



Booking Product Featured App for Service Marketplaces
-------------------------------
To enable service booking functionality, the Marketplace app supports a dedicated **Booking Product featured app**. This app allows services to be offered as **bookable products** within the marketplace.

With the Booking Product featured app:

- Sellers can create booking-based service products  
- Sellers can define available dates and time slots  
- Customers can select their preferred date and time during checkout  
- Service bookings are processed within the marketplace order workflow  

This makes it suitable for service providers who require structured booking instead of standard product purchases.

How Booking Product Supports a Service Marketplace
-----------------------------
The Booking Product featured app provides essential functionality for service-based marketplaces:

- **Time-Slot Based Service Booking**  
  Services can be booked based on predefined availability.

- **Seller-Level Availability Management**  
  Each seller can manage their own service schedule independently.

- **Prevention of Booking Conflicts**  
  Booking availability helps avoid overlapping service bookings.

- **Marketplace Workflow Integration**  
  Service bookings follow the same order flow as standard marketplace orders.



Why Use Booking Product for Service-Based Marketplaces
--------------------------
Service-based marketplaces require reliable scheduling and availability management. The **Booking Product featured app** fulfills this requirement by enabling structured service booking while remaining fully integrated with the Marketplace app.

This allows marketplace owners to scale service offerings without relying on external booking systems or additional customization.
