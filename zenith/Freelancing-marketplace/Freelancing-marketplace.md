Freelancing Marketplace
-----------------------

A **Freelancing Marketplace** is a platform where service providers (freelancers) and buyers connect to discuss, negotiate, and finalize custom service-based projects.  
Unlike fixed-price product marketplaces, freelancing platforms require **direct communication and flexible pricing** to close deals effectively.

Using the **Marketplace app**, you can build a multivendor freelancing marketplace where sellers list their services and buyers interact with them before placing an order.

Why Communication & Negotiation Matter in Freelancing
-----------------------------------------------------

In a freelancing ecosystem, buyers usually want to:
- Clarify project requirements  
- Understand timelines and deliverables  
- Discuss customization possibilities  
- Negotiate pricing based on scope  

To support this workflow, the Marketplace app offers dedicated feature apps that make freelancing marketplaces more interactive and conversion-focused.



Ask a Question – Pre-Sales Communication for Freelancers
-------------------------------------------------------

The **Ask a Question** feature allows buyers to directly communicate with freelancers before placing an order.

This feature helps buyers:
- Ask service-related questions  
- Clarify scope, tools, or expertise  
- Reduce confusion before purchase  

At the same time, freelancers can respond from their seller panel, ensuring transparency and better buyer confidence.

### How Ask a Question Helps a Freelancing Marketplace
- Improves buyer trust before hiring  
- Reduces order disputes  
- Encourages informed decision-making  
- Supports custom service discussions

Make an Offer – Flexible Pricing & Deal Negotiation
---------------------------------------------------

Freelancing projects often do not follow fixed pricing models.  
The **Make an Offer** feature allows buyers and freelancers to negotiate custom pricing and terms before order placement.

With this feature:
- Buyers can submit custom price offers  
- Freelancers can accept, reject, or counter offers  
- Accepted offers are converted into marketplace orders  

### How Make an Offer Benefits Freelancing Marketplaces
- Supports custom and project-based pricing  
- Enables negotiation-driven workflows  
- Increases conversion for high-value services  
- Provides flexibility for both buyers and freelancers

1. Buyers ask questions to understand service details  
2. Freelancers respond and clarify requirements  
3. Buyers submit a custom offer
