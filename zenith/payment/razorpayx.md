Want to pay your Seller through your Razor PayX account. Then you can enable this feature in Multivendor Marketplace.

**Purpose of this feature**:

This feature allows the merchant to use the Razor PayX gateway to pay their Sellers through the Multivendor app.

**Note: This feature only works for the Merchant and Seller based in the India** **only.**

### How to configure the Razor PayX feature?

First, go to Multi vendor Marketplace **Admin Panel** **\>** **Payment > Select Payment Methods**

![ere](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ere-1200x616.png)

_**Note:** Whenever you update the configuration, the previous orders will not remain eligible for payout anymore._

_For example, if we make changes to the Razor PayX details, only the upcoming orders will be eligible for payout and not the previous ones._

Now on the redirected page go to Razor PayX and Click on "three dots" > Select Admin Payment Configuration

![dsk](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dsk-1200x230.png)

Admin will get a pop-up for Admin RazorpayX Configuration

![fdnfdbjh](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fdnfdbjh.png)

You need to fill in this information and then save only then you would be able to "Enable" the razor payx on your Multivendor app.

If you enable the Razor PayX without providing the details then Seller won't be able to add their Razor PayX method at their Seller panel.

### Auto Pay Configuration

You can enable Razor PayX auto pay configuration to automatically pay to your Sellers

![cmbxchbx](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/cmbxchbx-1200x448.png)

You can select Pay After Delivery or fulfill so whenever the Seller marks the order as Delivered or Fulfilled as per the configuration. The payment to Seller will automatically be initiated.

In case you have enabled the [**Cashable amount**](/zenith/payment/paypal.html#pay-after-refund-date) the payment will be initiated after the refund days.

Save

That is not for the admin Side now Seller needs to configure the Razor PayX at their Seller panel side.

### Configuration for Seller’s Panel

Sellers need login to their Seller Panel > Profile > Payment Details > In Payment Method > Select RazorPayX

_**Note:** This payment method will only work if the Seller's address is from India as Razor PayX is not compatible with any other country._

Once they select the Payment Method as RazorPayX they will get a form to fill in their bank details as shown in the below image:

![hg](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hg-1200x654.png)

**Note:** In case of testing you can add any random number for the account number and valid IFSC code but please make sure you provide the correct number of digits.

For example: If you have added SBI as your Bank name then please add 10 digit number for the account.

------------------

Sellers need to Provide their UPI id as shown in the below image:

![dsdkjb](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dsdkjb-1200x478.png)

Once the Seller saves Account details successfully. Contact will be created at the Admin Razor PayX account as shown in the below image:

![uyguygyu](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/uyguygyu-1200x425.png)

**Note:** _Please make sure that you don't make any changes here in the contact from the Razor side as it won't be synced with the Multivendor app._

### Payment Flow

Now as per the Multivendor [Payment Flow](/zenith/payment/seller-payment.html#how-admin-pays-to-sellers) when Admin Pays the Seller due amount through RazorPayX.

![chatwhizz__2_-3](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/chatwhizz__2_-3.png)

So when Admin pays the Seller the amount will be gone into transit state at the Multivendor and Razor side.

![unnamed-file](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/unnamed-file-1200x418.png)

![ddc](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ddc-1200x435.png)

Once the status is updated from the Razor dashboard then it will automatically will gets updated at Multivendor App.

![dgd](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/dgd-1200x426.png)

In case due to some reason the amount is reversed then it also gets updated as refunded in the Multivendor app.
