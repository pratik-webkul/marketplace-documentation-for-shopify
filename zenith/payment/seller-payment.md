**Shopify Multivendor Marketplace | Seller Payment Flow |**

The [Multivendor Marketplace app for Shopify](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-new-theme-launched/) is a great tool to convert your shop into a fully functioning marketplace,allowing you to manage seller payments .

This user manual perfectly guides you to understand the Seller **payment** in the Multivendor Marketplace app for Shopify, from setting up the payment methods to sending the payments to your sellers.

By default, Admin receives the complete amount of the order paid by the buyer/customer, and then Admin transfers it to the seller after deducting his/her commission.

Admin can pay sellers/vendors by five payment methods in the multivendor app, in which three payment methods are online and two payment methods are offline.

**Online Payment Methods:-**


By these payment methods, the admin can pay sellers online through the app. Both admin and sellers must have a business PayPal account.

*   PayPal
*   PayFast
*   Razorpayx

**Offline Payment Methods:-** 


Admin can use these payment methods offline and can just track the amount in the app and can have a record of the way you pay the seller.

*   Internet Banking
*   Bank Wire Transfer

### Shopify Multivendor Marketplace | Payment Flow

### Payment Methods Setup:-

Firstly, the admin needs to set up the payment methods for payments to the sellers from the admin panel of the app.

Admin end of Multivendor Marketplace app >> Payment >> Payment Method >> Enable the payment methods from here >> Save

![payment](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/pay1-1200x498.webp)

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pays.webp)

Now, the same payment methods will be available at the seller's end. The seller chooses the payment methods through which they want the admin to pay them.

Seller end of Multivendor Marketplace app->> Profile->> Payment details->> Here choose any payment method from drop-down menu->> Save

![payment](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/payt.webp)

![payment](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/payfr.webp)

The admin can edit or change the payment methods that the sellers add from their respective panels.

### HOW ADMIN PAYS TO SELLERS:

To proceed, the admin first needs to select the seller payment type based on how they wish to pay the seller.

They can either choose to pay the total amount at once or, alternatively, opt for an order-wise payment method.

The selected option will, **ultimately**, determine how and when the seller receives their earnings.

**Seller Payment Type:**

You will now have the option to pay the sellers **the whole amount of all the orders together** or **pay for individual orders separately**.

Go to the **Multivendor Marketplace app** >>**Payment** >> **Seller Payment Configuration** >> Payment Setting >> Seller Payment Type >> Select the option and save

![payment](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay6.webp)

### Pay the total Amount

![payment](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay7.webp)

Now, to pay to sellers, the admin needs to visit the “Seller Payments” section under the “payment” menu in the admin panel of the multivendor marketplace app

The system will display a list of sellers on the redirected page. The admin can select the seller they wish to pay by clicking the 'View' button available under the three-dot menu.

![pay 8](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay8.webp)

After this, the admin needs to click on the ‘Pay’ button, which will redirect them to the Seller Payment Details page.

![pay 9](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay9.webp)

Here, the admin can first select the date range to fetch the seller's orders.

![pay10](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay10.webp)

Then, after reviewing the list, they can manually choose the specific orders they want to pay for. Additionally, this step-by-step process ensures more control and flexibility over payments.

By default, the system automatically selects all transactions; **however**, the admin can **further** review the list and **if necessary**, modify the selection to better suit their specific payout preferences.

**In addition**, this flexibility allows for more accurate and customized payment handling.

After selecting the desired orders, the admin clicks on the ‘Pay’ button again.

![pay11](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay11.webp)

A pop-up will appear, allowing the admin to choose a payment method and proceed to pay the seller.

![pay12](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay12.webp)

The Payment page displays the selected orders' earnings and the unsettled amount.

**Unsettled Amount:** During the payment process, the admin pays the seller.

Meanwhile, we also display the ‘Unsettled Amount’ to provide a clear breakdown of pending charges.

This unsettled amount includes any refunded amounts or shipping label costs borne by the admin/seller. The system automatically handles these adjustments at the time of payment.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay13.webp)

Below the ‘Unsettled Amount’, there is a ‘View’ option that allows the admin to see the detailed transactions related to the unsettled amount.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unsettlement-amount-915x1024.webp)

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-unsettle-amount-1200x569.webp)

For example, if the seller owes $10 but a $7 refund was issued to a customer on their behalf,

Then, during **payment**, the admin deducts the $7 from the seller’s due amount.

The total selected amount will still show as $10, but the unsettled amount will be – $7. As a result, the admin pays $3 to the seller and marks the payment as complete.

Here, the unsettled amount includes refunded order amounts, shipping label charges, etc., that the system has not settled yet.

Admin can also view the records involved in the Unsettled Amount by clicking on the View button under the Unsettled Amount.

After deducting the unsettled amount from the selected orders' earnings:

*   If the resulting payable amount is greater than 0, then he can proceed to pay using the activated payment method in the app.

*   If the resulting payable amount equals 0, then you do not need to take any action.

*   If the resulting payable amount is less than 0, then the admin can still proceed to settle the amount.
*   However, it’s important to note that this action will only update the records in the app; it will not, in fact, perform an actual payout transaction.

### Seller Payment Management:

1\. 2 tabs under **Seller Payment** view page

*   Payouts -> This includes the payout transactions to the seller.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay16.webp)

*   All Transactions -> this includes all the other transactions like order earnings added, order refunds, shipping label cost deducted, order edits, etc.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay17.webp)

2\. Under the payouts transaction listing, the admin can view the details of records involved in the payout, i.e., order earnings and other unsettled amounts.

3\. If any payout transaction fails, then the admin can manually re-trigger the failed payout from the listing under the Action button.

**2\. Pay Order Wise:**

If you choose ‘Pay Order Wise’, it means you want to pay your sellers separately for each individual order.

To make payments order-wise, the admin needs to navigate to the Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Orders > Order Listing.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay18.webp)

Next, carefully select the order you wish to pay for. Then, from the three-dot menu under the Action menu, click the ‘View’ button to proceed.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pau19.webp)

On the redirected page, you will find the ‘Pay to Seller’ option, through which the admin can process the payment.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay20.webp)

A pop-up will appear, allowing the admin to choose a payment method and proceed to pay the seller.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay21.webp)

### **AUTO PAY**

    After the customer pays the amount for the order, the amount will go to the respective Seller and Admin account directly, as per the share configured on the basis of commission.  
    Both the admin & seller need to have their respective Stripe accounts. [Know more](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multi-vendor-marketplace-stripe-connect-integration/).

ADD SELLER TOTAL DUE EARNING


The **Shopify Multi Vendor Marketplace (MVM)** app gives store admins better control over how seller earnings are tracked.

The feature is called **"Add Seller Total Due Earning,"** and **with the help of this**, you can define **precisely** when a seller's order earnings should be reflected in their payment summary.

**Furthermore**, this allows for better control over payment timing and ensures that earnings are calculated according to your preferred schedule.yment summary.

**How to Configure the Feature**:

To enable and use the **Add Seller Total Due Earning** setting, follow these simple steps:

*   Log in to your Admin Panel of Marketplace.

*   **Payment > Seller Payment Configuration > Payment Setting**

*   Scroll to find the **“Add Seller Total Due Earning”** option.

*   Choose the desired condition from the drop-down menu to determine when the order amount should be considered as part of the seller’s **due earnings**.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay26.webp)

**Available Options in the Drop-down Menu**:

You can **easily** choose from the following four options, **depending on your business preference**.

**Moreover**, each option offers a different level of flexibility and control to suit your specific payout strategy.

1.  **On Order Placed**  
    Earnings are added to the seller’s total due amount as soon as the order is placed by the customer.
2.  **On Paid Order**  
    The seller's earnings will be counted only after the order has been marked as paid.
3.  **On Order Delivered**  
    The due earnings will be reflected only once the order is delivered to the customer.
4.  **On Refund Days Completed**  
    Earnings are added after the refund window for the order is over—ensuring security against possible returns or cancellations.

_**Note :**_

_If you want to add the seller’s total due earnings after the completion of the refund period, then first ensure that you activate the **“Enable Cashable Amount for Sellers”** option._

_Additionally, this setting helps in accurately calculating and paying out only those earnings that are no longer subject to refunds._

_Therefore, enabling this option is crucial for maintaining financial accuracy and transparency._

ENABLE CASHABLE AMOUNT FOR SELLER:
    
To enable and use the **Enable Cashable Amount For Seller** setting, follow these simple steps:

*   Log in to your Admin Panel of Marketplace.

*   **Payment > Seller Payment Configuration > Payment Setting**

*   Scroll to find the **“**Enable Cashable Amount For Seller**”** option.

![Seller Payments](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pay27.webp)

When the "Enable Cashable Amount For Seller" option is activated, the system will **thereafter** calculate and show **only** the earnings of those orders **for which** the refund period has expired.

**In this way**, sellers can **accurately** view the actual payable amount after all eligible refunds have been accounted for.

**Additionally**, this helps in avoiding any confusion regarding earnings. **As a result**, sellers gain better clarity and confidence in the payment process.

This ensures that:

*   Sellers do not receive payments for orders that are still within the refundable window.

*   Admins can avoid complications or overpayments if a buyer initiates a return or cancellation during the refund period.

*   The seller's **cashable amount** reflects the earnings that are final, with no risk of deduction due to future refunds.

### **Admin Can View Previous Payments in the Multivendor Marketplace App**:

If there is any pending old payment for a seller, **then** we have conveniently provided a **'View Previous Payment'** button on the Seller Payment page.

**In this way**, the admin can **quickly and efficiently** access past transactions and ensure that no payments are missed.

**Moreover**, it enhances payment tracking and helps maintain accurate financial records. **As a result**, the overall payout process becomes more transparent and reliable.

**In addition**, it helps maintain transparency and accurate financial records.

This button will only be visible for sellers who have pending payments.

Once the admin clicks on this button, the system displays the old pending payment amount, and the admin can then proceed to make the payment directly from that screen.

**Steps to View Previous Payments:**

*   Log in to the **Admin Panel** of the Multivendor Marketplace app.
