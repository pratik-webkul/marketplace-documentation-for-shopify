[Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/) has got the Stripe Connect Payment Gateway.

Using this, the order amount directly goes to the respective Seller & Admin account as per the share configured on the basis of commission.

If customers are applying a discount code on the orders, then all the order amount will be send to the Admin Stripe Account. And then Admin will send the seller earning to his account.

But if seller is bearing the discount, the amount will be split, i.e., the whole amount will not be receive by admin.

**NOTE**:- Both admin & seller need to have their respective Stripe accounts. Moreover, if you are using the older version of Stripe API (before 2019-08-14), make sure to upgrade it to the latest version.

To use this payment gateway, the admin needs to enable the [Stripe Connect](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multi-vendor-marketplace-stripe-connect-integration/) from the **feature app section**:

This is only supported when both admin stripe account and the connected seller's stripe account are in the same region: both in Europe or both in the U.S. [Know more](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges-transfers)

In other words, the destination charges will only work for the orders with the product(s) from a single seller.
