## B2B Marketplace

A **B2B (Business-to-Business) Marketplace** is a platform where businesses sell products to other businesses. Unlike B2C marketplaces, B2B marketplaces usually require more controlled and flexible pricing structures to support wholesale and business-oriented selling models.

B2B marketplaces are commonly used by wholesalers, manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers who want to manage pricing efficiently within a multivendor environment.

## B2B Pricing Requirements

In a B2B marketplace, pricing is often not limited to a single fixed price. Instead, sellers may need to apply different pricing rules for specific products based on predefined conditions.

To support this requirement, the marketplace needs a mechanism that allows **structured pricing logic at the product level** without frequent manual price changes.

The Slot Pricing feature works using **product tags**. Based on the configured tags and defined slot rules, specific pricing can be applied to tagged products. This makes it suitable for B2B and wholesale-style pricing scenarios where controlled pricing behavior is required.
