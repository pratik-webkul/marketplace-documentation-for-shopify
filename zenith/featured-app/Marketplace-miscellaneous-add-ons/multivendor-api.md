Now, let's see how the marketplace sellers will get access to multi-vendor APIs.

### How to Allow Sellers to Get Access to APIs?

#### **ADMIN PANEL**

With this new API Version 2, You can allow sellers to get the API credentials & let them access Multi-vendor APIs with limited permissions.

You need to follow the below-given steps:-

*   Visit the **Sellers** section of the Multi-vendor app.
*   Click the **Seller Listing** menu.
*   Select the seller to which you want to permit the API access.

![select sellers](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/31112716/AwesomeScreenshot-shopify-trunk-webkul-shopify-mp-admin-index.php-2019-07-31_4_44.png)

*   Visiting the Edit Seller section of the app, scroll down to the bottom to get the option to Generate API credentials for your sellers.

As soon as the admin clicks the Generate API credentials button, a pop-up appears and you will be asked to set resource permissions for your sellers. Enable the **checkbox** to assign permission.

Clicking the **Save** button, a unique access token gets generated for the seller that will reflect at the seller side too.
