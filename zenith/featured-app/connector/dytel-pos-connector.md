DYTEL POS offers a seamless, centralized system for managing orders, payments, and inventory in one place.

If you have a restaurant marketplace and use DYTEL POS, you can streamline operations by integrating it with [Shopify Multivendor Marketplace](https://apps.shopify.com/multi-vendor-marketplace) for efficient vendor and transaction management .

DYTEL POS integrates with the [Multivendor Marketplace](/zenith/introduction/overview.html), syncing Marketplace store orders directly into the seller's POS system .

This Integration allows you to sync the seller orders to the DYTEL POS in real time .

 INSTALLATION
---------------------------
To make this app work, first of all, you need to visit the “Feature Apps” section of the multivendor app. There you will get the “DYTEL POS CONNECTOR” feature app.

![dytel-pos-integration-enable](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/dytel-pos-enable-1200x943.webp)

After that you have to approve the payments of this feature app to use this on your store.

And as soon as you agree with this condition and approve the payment you will get the DYTEL POS CONNECTOR installed on your store.Thus, this DYTEL POS CONNECTOR gets enabled on your marketplace.
