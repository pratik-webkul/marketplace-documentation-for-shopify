With [Multivendor Marketplace](/zenith/introduction/) App, You can convert your store into a marketplace where multiple sellers can register and sell their products all over the globe.

You might know about [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/), a well-known online global marketplace that focuses on selling handmade goods and vintage items.

So, if Your sellers have their stores on Etsy too and they want to sell their Etsy store's products on the admin's marketplace then use the **Seller** **Etsy Connector** App.

To connect the Etsy store with the admin's marketplace, Seller needs to "**Create An App**" on his/her Etsy Store and get the API & Secret Key to establish the connection.

Admin can enable this feature app by approving the additional charge of $25 USD/month.

Thus, allows sellers to import their Etsy store's products to the admin's Multivendor Marketplace. Accordingly, manage the inventory at both ends.

Let's Explore the Features in detail.

### Additional Features

![Connector-Configurations-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Connector-Configurations-Admin-1200x597.png)

That's all about the Configuration done from the admin end. Furthermore, moving on to the Seller end

And let's see how the Sellers manage the configuration to connect their Etsy store with the admin's marketplace.

### Etsy Configuration

![S2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Dashboard-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2.png)

As soon as the admin installs the Shopify-Etsy Connector feature app in the Multivendor Marketplace App. Furthermore, the Configuration menu in the Seller Panel gains a new sub-menu.

### Etsy App Configuration

To set up the **"Etsy App Configuration"**, sellers can authenticate the Etsy connector app by clicking the **"Authenticate Your App"** button.

This will open a new page where you should select **"Authenticate Multivendor-Etsy Connector App"**.

From there, log in to your Handmade Marketplace account, complete the app authentication, and you will be automatically directed to the Multivendor Seller panel.

### Inventory Sync Timing

In the "Inventory Sync Timing" section of the Etsy Configuration, sellers have the ability to specify the three-time slots for synchronizing their product inventory.

### Bulk update product inventory from Etsy

The sellers also have the option to manually synchronize their product inventory from Etsy in bulk.

![screenshot_1697212932233](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_1697212932233.png)

### Tag Mapping

Clicking on "Tag Mapping," sellers will have the option to map product tags. Sellers can also disable or delete mapped tags according to their needs.

![screenshot_1691765238797](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot_1691765238797-1200x614.png)

### Import Products

Once the Seller authenticates the Etsy Connector app, the system adds an "Import Products" button to the same page.

Further, by clicking on the "Import Product" button, the Seller will get two methods to import his Etsy store's product to Shopify.

### **Method 1: Using single or comma-separated Listing ID(s)**

By using this method, the Seller should enter the Listing ID(s) of the products they wish to import and then click the "Import" button.

This action will import the specified products from Etsy to the Multivendor Marketplace app.

![screenshot_1691753740352](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/screenshot_1691753740352-1200x616.webp)

### Method 2: By CSV

By using this method the sellers can add their products in bulk via CSV

They can download the example product listing CSV to add their products

![screenshot_1697213257254](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_1697213257254.png)

### Admin End

Once the products get imported into the Multivendor app, they will be in an approval pending state at both ends (admin and seller end).

It is up to the admin if he/she approves or rejects the products to be sold on the admin's marketplace.

If the admin denies the imported product, he/she needs to add a reason for the rejection.

**Let's See how it Works:**

Suppose a product is added on Etsy and Seller has imported this product from Etsy to Multivendor App.

![s33](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-27.png)

![s22](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Screenshot-28.png)

This is how the imported product appears on the Multivendor App.

![s11](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Product-Admin-1.png)

Admin can enable, deny or delete any imported products from his end.

Once the admin approves any product, the same will reflect in the Seller panel of the Multivendor App.

### Price Rule

Let the sellers create price rules to manage the product price of their PrestaShop store to the merchant’s store.

![Price rule ](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Dashboard-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1.png)

Sellers will have a new menu named **Connector Price Rule** in the configuration menu of the app.

From here, the seller can create price rules based on which the seller’s product price will be calculated on the merchant’s store. 

Clicking the **Connector Price Rule**, the seller needs to enable “Price Rule” status and select the options as increase/decrease price.

The price will be changed by a fixed amount or a percentage amount, enter the amount that needs to be changed.

![price rule](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Price-Rule-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

Further, enable the checkbox to update the already synced product’s price at the merchant’s store as per the price rule created.

This way, sellers can create price rules from their respective seller panels based on which product price of the seller’s store will be calculated at the merchant’s store.

That's all about the Shopify-Etsy Connector Feature App using which the admin can allow his/her sellers to connect their Etsy Store with the admin's Shopify store with ease.
