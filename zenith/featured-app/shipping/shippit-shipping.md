[Multi-Vendor Marketplace for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/) is now Integrated with another shipping add-on: **Shippit**

What is Shippit Shipping?
-------------------------

[Shippit](https://www.shippit.com/) is a web-based, multi-carrier shipping solution for e-commerce retailers. Designed to streamline the fulfillment process.

This feature will allow you to ship your goods via multiple carrier shipping methods. Moreover, you can automatically generate shipping labels.

**NOTE**:

The **Shippit** feature app is available only with the Multivendor **Pro** **Plan** ($60/month). Moreover, you need to enable the [**Shipping**](/zenith/featured-app/overview) add-on (free) from the ‘feature apps’ section of the app.

Above all, access to Shipping requires your Shopify store to be on the plan that supports **Real-Time Carrier-Calculated Shipping**.

Also, you can enable only one shipping method within Shippit to calculate the shipping rates.

**CHARGES**:

This feature will have an additional charge of **USD 10 per month** over & above your current Multivendor Marketplace plan.

SHIPPIT SHIPPING FEATURE APP IS AVAILABLE **BOTH FOR RATE CALCULATION & FULFILLMENT**.
