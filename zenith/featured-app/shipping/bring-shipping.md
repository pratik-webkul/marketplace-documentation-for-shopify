[Multi-Vendor Marketplace for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/) is here with another marketplace shipping feature app, i.e., **Bring**.

Using this featured app, the merchants can allow sellers to ship goods through the Bring shipping method and then print **Shipping Label**. Moreover, create a **pickup request**.

**CHARGES:**

This feature will have an additional charge of **USD 10 per month** over & above your current multivendor marketplace plan.

**NOTE:**

This feature app is available only with the Multivendor **Pro** **Plan** ($60/month). Moreover, you need to enable the [**Shipping**](/zenith/featured-app/overview) add-on (free) from the ‘featured apps’ section of the app.

Above all, access to Shipping requires your Shopify store to be on the plan that supports **Real-Time Carrier-Calculated Shipping**.
