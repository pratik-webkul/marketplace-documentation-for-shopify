E-commerce has become an essential part of our lives. Easyship has led to an increase in demand for shipping services.

From groceries to clothes and electronics, we can purchase almost everything online.

However, shipping can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially for small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses.

Considering these traits, Webkul is here with a new feature app called Easyship in Multivendor Marketplace App.

**PLEASE NOTE-**

*   The Easyship feature app is available only with the Multivendor **Pro** **Plan**. Moreover, you need to enable the **[Shipping](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-shipping/)** Add-on for FREE from the ‘Feature Apps’ section of the app.

*   Also, Access to Shipping requires your Shopify store to be on the plan that supports [**Real-Time Carrier-Calculated Shipping**.](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/enabling-shipping-carriers)
