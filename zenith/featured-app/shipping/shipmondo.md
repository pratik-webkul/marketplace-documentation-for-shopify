[Multi-Vendor Marketplace for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/) is here with another marketplace shipping feature add-on, i.e., **Shipmondo**.

**[Shipmondo](https://shipmondo.com/)**: They help you ship goods worldwide across carriers from one platform.

Making it possible for you to offer different shipping options to your customers. Note that currently, we only support Postnord Shipping within Shipmondo.

Using this featured app, merchants can allow vendors to ship their goods via multiple carrier shipping methods and then print the shipping label.

**Charges:** This feature will have an additional charge of **USD 10 per month** over & above your current multivendor marketplace plan.

**Before You Install**: It is mandatory to have **[real-time carrier calculated shipping](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/enabling-shipping-carriers)** within your Shopify store.

This is a requirement defined by Shopify for your store to retrieve shipping rates from third-party sources, such as this shipping app.

This feature app is available only with the Multivendor **Pro** **Plan** ($60/month). Moreover, you need to enable the [**Shipping**](/zenith/featured-app/overview) add-on (free) from the ‘featured apps’ section of the app.
