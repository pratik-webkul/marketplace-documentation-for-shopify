The [Multi-vendor Marketplace](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-new-theme-launched/) has introduced another shipping feature app for order fulfillment named [**Swiss Post**](https://www.post.ch/en/) i.e **the national postal service of Switzerland.**

By enabling the Swiss Post shipping featured app, the admin can allow sellers to manage the order fulfillment via Swiss Post shipping.

Also, automatically generate shipping labels for the orders.

This feature app will charge you a minimal amount of **$10 per month** over and above your current Multivendor plan.

NOTE:- This Swiss Post shipping feature app is available only with the Multivendor **Pro** **Plan** ($60/month).

Moreover, you need to enable the **[Shipping](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-shipping/)** Add-on for FREE from the ‘Feature Apps’ section of the app.

Also, Access to Shipping requires your Shopify store to be on the plan that supports [**Real-Time Carrier-Calculated Shipping**.](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/enabling-shipping-carriers)

The Swiss post Shipping feature is compatible with the **[Partial Fulfillment](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-partial-fulfillment/)** feature.

SWISS POST FEATURE APP IS AVAILABLE **ONLY FOR FULFILLMENT**.
