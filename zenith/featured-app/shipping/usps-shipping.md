Coming to the USPS Configuration:-
----------------------------------

Now, the admin needs to configure USPS and stamps details from the "USPS Configuration" section of the admin panel.

Here, the admin needs to fill the following details such as USPS User ID, Stamps User ID, Password, and Integration ID.

**Please Note**:- In order to get the "USPS User ID", the admin can get registered through USPS. You can go through the link below to get registered: [https://registration.shippingapis.com/](https://registration.shippingapis.com/)

You can choose the domestic as well as international shipping service from this section.

Also, the admin can enable the "Automatic Generate Shipping Label" button to allow his sellers to generate and print the shipping label for fulfilled items.

You will now have an option to choose "**who will bear the extra shipping charges"**(whether it will be the admin or the seller).

Once you select "Admin" to bear the Shipping Label cost, the process will be the same(admin will pay the shipping label cost).

However, if you want your sellers to bear the Shipping Label Cost then the seller will pay the shipping label cost as per the shipping configured by the admin.

Let us see how the seller configures these shipping details on his/her end.

As soon as the seller enables the USPS shipping method on his/her end, a new button gets enabled i.e. "**Global Configuration"**. The seller can configure the shipping packet details from here.
