[Multi-Vendor Marketplace for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/) is here with another marketplace shipping feature app, i.e., **FedEx**.

FedEx
-----

[FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html) Corporation is an American multinational courier delivery service.

Using this featured app, the merchants can enable shipment through **FedEx**. Moreover, he can allow **US** **sellers** to automatically generate shipping labels.

**FedEx** feature app is available only with the Multivendor **Pro** **Plan** ($60/month). Moreover, you need to enable the [**Shipping**](/zenith/featured-app/overview) add-on (free) from the 'featured apps' section of the app.

**CHARGES:**

This feature will have an additional charge of **USD 10 per month** over & above your current multivendor marketplace plan.

**NOTE:**

Above all, access to Shipping requires your Shopify store to be on the plan that supports **Real-Time Carrier-Calculated Shipping**.

Currently, the FedEx Shipping feature app will only work for **US Merchants**.

FEDEX SHIPPING IS BOTH FOR **RATE CALCULATION & FULFILLMENT**
