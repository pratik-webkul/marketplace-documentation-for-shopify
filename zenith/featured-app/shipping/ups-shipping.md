[**Multi-vendor Marketplace**](/zenith/introduction/) app has come up with the **UPS** feature app to manage product shipping, track the packages & print shipping labels through the **United Parcel Service (UPS)**.

You can now visit the feature app section and enable the "UPS" feature app to let the sellers ship their products through UPS.

For this, you need to have a UPS account as you need your account details to configure UPS shipping in the app. In addition to it, you can allow sellers to generate shipping labels of fulfilled orders through UPS.

This feature of the Multivendor app will charge you an additional amount of $10 USD per month over and above your current Multivendor plan.

> To make UPS shipping feature work, you need to choose the Shopify store plan which supports the **“Real-Time Carrier-Calculated Shipping”.**

**Important Note**:- “UPS Feature is available only in the Multivendor **PRO ($60/month)** Plan **+** You need to enable the “[Shipping” Feature App](/zenith/featured-app/overview) which is **FREE** of cost.”

THIS SHIPPING FEATURE APP IS USED FOR **BOTH RATE CALCULATION** AND **FULFILLMENT.**

**Note - New account users do not require UPS Access Keys. Once you configure the UPS Client\_id and Client\_secret Name, the system will automatically generate the Access token.**

### Admin Panel

**Note: Kindly choose only those shipping services which you need. Don’t keep all the services selected otherwise it creates delay to retrieve shipping rates at the storefront.**

As soon as you enable the UPS featured app, a new sub-menu gets added to the Configuration menu of the app i.e. **UPS** **Configuration**.

![UPS Configuration](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dashconfiguration.webp)

Now, Go to the **UPS Configuration** section and enter all the details from your UPS account such as UPS access key, choose the shipping service (domestic or international), UPS shipper number, username, password, etc.

**Note - New account users do not require UPS Access Keys. Once you configure the UPS Client\_id and Client\_secret Name, the system will automatically generate the Access token.**

**By default, we show the negotiated shipping rates. However, in case the negotiated shipping rates are not present, we show the general shipping rate**

### DEFAULT PICK-UP ADDRESS

If there is an overseas order in UPS shipping the in case if you want both addresses i.e. "seller's address and default pick up address saved in UPS dashboard" should be sent to the customer.

Then you can enable "DEFAULT PICK UP ADDRESS " from UPS configuration.

### Make **Shipping** **Address Phone Number** Mandatory

To use this feature add-on, the admin needs to make the **Shipping** **address phone number mandatory** at the time of **checkout**.

So, to do this, go to **Shopify Backend** > **Settings** > **Checkout** > Under **Form Options**, make **Shipping** **address phone number** as **Required**.

Refer:-

### Seller Panel

Once the admin configures the UPS details from his end, the same will reflect at the seller end. And now the seller needs to visit the "**Shipping Configuration**" menu & enable the **UPS** feature.

![shipping](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sellersideconfig.webp)

There, the seller will get the UPS shipping method. Clicking the "Enable" button, the seller can activate the UPS for all his/her products.

![UPS enabled](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/upssellerenabled.webp)

Once enabled, the seller can set it as "Default" shipping method.

![Set as default](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Shipping-Configuration-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1-1.png)

Now, the sellers need to configure the Shipping Packet details from the "**Global Configuration**" section of the seller panel.

![shipping package](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/configureupsseller.webp)

> **NOTE**:- Admin can also set the shipping method as UPS by default for any seller's product from Seller Listing menu of the app.

ADMIN PANEL:-

![UPS shipping](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Edit-Seller-Admin-1-1.png)

Once the seller enables the "UPS", he/she can now choose UPS as a shipping method while adding a product.

**ADD PRODUCT FORM:-**

![Select shipping](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot12.png)

Now, the seller can ship products via UPS.

### Shipping Label Generation

Moreover, once the order is fulfilled by the seller, he/she can now generate the shipping label from the order detail section of the app.

Seller first needs to select the method of order fulfillment as UPS and fulfill the order.

![order fulfillment](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/orderfullpage.webp)

![UPS shipping](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot13.png)

Once the order gets fulfilled, sellers can generate shipping label of the fulfilled order.

![Print Shipping Label](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/generateshiipinglabel.webp)

A shipping label will be printed in the form of **gif**.

![Shipping Label](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screenshot-14-.png)

This is all about the Shipping Label Generation through UPS Fulfilment.  

### Select the Usage-UPS Configuration

While configuring the UPS details, you can now choose to **Send To Merchant** if you want to fulfill the order and generate shipping labels on your warehouse address.

OR choose Both **(Shipping+Fulfillment)**, if you want the sellers to manage the order fulfillment & generate shipping labels for customer's orders.

Go to Configuration>>UPS Configuration>>Select Usage As.

Select either **Send To Merchant** OR **Both** (Shipping+Fulfillment) while configuring the UPS details.

![Screenshot9-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot9-1-1200x614.png)

Let's understand both cases.

**Case 1: Both (Fulfillment+Shipping)  
**In this case, once an order is placed, the seller will be responsible to manage shipment & order fulfillment.

**Case 2: Send To Merchant  
**This is the case when the admin adds his/her own warehouse address and manage the order fulfillment & shipping label.

Once you choose this option, you will have the option to add a warehouse location.

![Screenshot-85-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-85-1-1200x619.png)

Clicking on the button, the admin will add location.

![UPS-Configuration-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/UPS-Configuration-Admin-1154x1024.png)

Now, as soon as an order is placed, the seller will have the option to send the parcel to the admin for fulfillment.  
For this, the seller needs to visit the Order Listing section>>Select an Order>>Click View (Action). This will redirect the seller to the order detail page.

In the fulfillment detail section, the seller needs to click the "**Ship To Merchant"** button to send the parcel to the admin.

![Screenshot-86-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-86-1-1200x614.png)

Choose UPS as a method of fulfillment.

![UPS shipping
](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-87-1-1200x620.png)

Selecting the UPS shipping, the seller needs to choose a shipping method and click **Agree & fulfill** button.

![Order-Details-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Order-Details-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2-1-1200x821.png)

This way, the order gets fulfilled and the product quantity will get updated at the merchant's warehouse address.
