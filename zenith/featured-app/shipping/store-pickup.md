If you are running an online store, isn't it a great idea to provide a streamlined pick up process to your customers so that they can pick up their orders on their own and avoid shipping rates.

Also, the Store Owner will steer clear of trouble in managing Returns & Exchanges.

Considering these traits, Webkul is here with a new feature app called **Store Pick up**.

Using the [Multivendor Marketplace](/zenith/introduction/) Store Pick-up feature app, the admin can allow his sellers to provide an order pickup option to the customers.

Thus, customers can pick up their orders from the seller's store and get rid of the shipping rates.

Once the admin activates this feature on his/her end, the seller can enable the store pickup option which will be applicable to all the products of that seller.

Seller will provide his store address as the "Store Pickup Address".

This feature app is at the monthly charge of **$10 USD per month** in addition to your current Multivendor plan.

**Important Note:-** In order to make this feature work please make sure that you are using the [Shipping feature](/zenith/featured-app/overview) of the Multivendor app.

Once the Store Pickup feature app is enabled, a " Store Pickup" Column will be visible on the Sellers >> Locations page.

![screenshot_1696415802665](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot_1696415802665.png)

### Seller End Configuration

The sellers will get the option to enable the Store Pick up from their seller panel.

For this, the seller needs to visit the **Configuration** section of the seller panel where they can configure the store pickup details.

Take a glance at the procedure:

Visit Multivendor Seller Panel>>Go to the Configuration menu>>Get the **Store Pickup Configuration** from drop-down menu>>Configure the details>>Save.

![Enable store pick-up](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Store-Pickup-Config-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

The seller can create multiple store pickup locations.

![Add-Location-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Add-Location-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1042x1024.png)

Location created.

![Screenshot-2020-10-16T183143.132](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-16T183143.132-1200x545.png)

The seller can edit, disable, delete the locations added. Moreover, they can add more locations. Go to Seller End>>Configurations\>>**Locations**.

![Screenshot-2020-10-16T183302.989](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-16T183302.989-1200x475.png)

Now, once the seller visits the Store Pickup Configuration section, he/she can enable the Store Pickup button to make it visible for the customers on the frontend of every product page.

Once the seller enables the Store Pickup tab, he/she can select whether he/she wants to enable this feature on all products or on some specific products of his/her store.

Now, there will be two options and the seller will choose either (**Delivery +** **Store Pickup)** or **Only Store Pickup** option to display for the customers on the product page.

The seller can also select a default option for the customers either **Store Pickup** or **Delivery.**

**NOTE:** _If the seller/admin enables the "USE LOCATION FOR PRODUCT" option,_

_And disable store pickup for a particular location from the Locations section, inventory management will still be applicable for that location._

![Store pick up](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Store-Pickup-Config-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

*   In case the seller wants to enable the store pickup option for all the products, the store pickup option will be available for all the products.
*   If the seller wants to set the store pickup option on some specific products then, he can simply choose the option as "**Specific Product**" from the drop-down menu.

![store pickup-specific products](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/08040422/Screenshot-46.png)

**While adding/editing products**
---------------------------------

Once the seller selects the "**Specific Product**" option, he/she will get the option to choose (**Delivery +** **Store Pick-up)** or Only **Store Pick-up or** Only **Delivery** while adding or editing any product.

Thus, the seller can set different options for his/her customers on each product.

![choose store pickup option](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/08041532/Screenshot12-2.png)

![Seller Address](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Store-Pickup-Config-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2.png)![Label Configuration](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Store-Pickup-Config-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-3.png)

Moreover, sellers can configure the labels within the app.

Now once the seller configures the store pickup details on his/her panel, admin now needs to make this functionality visible on the frontend on every product page.

This can be possible only when the admin will configure the settings on his/her panel.

### Configure FrontEnd

In order to show the store pickup option on product description page, admin needs to paste the given code into its respective template file.

![Instruction](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dashboard-Admin-1-1.png)

To do this, admin needs to visit the "Instruction for Marketplace" section of the multivendor app.

![Code Pasting](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Instructions-Admin.png)

Here in this section, you can scroll down to get the code and paste it into its respective template file as suggested.

To display the store pickup option on product page, You can copy the below given code and paste it into product.liquid (or product-template, if exist):
```liquid
<div id="wk\_store\_pickup\_div" data-productid="{{ product.id }}"></div>
```
Once you pasted the code, your customers can get the store pickup options on frontend.

Let's see how it will be visible on frontend.

### Visibility on Front End

By default, there will be two options visible to the customers on frontend if the seller has not selected the pickup option as "Store Pick-up Only".

If the customer selects the "Delivery" option, by default the same order process will be applied as per the marketplace app (i.e. Shipping is applied as per the rule).

![Coffee Mug](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Coffee-Mug-%E2%80%93-JohnDoe2-1-1200x627.png)

![Front end](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Coffee-Mug-%E2%80%93-JohnDoe2-1200x627.png)

But if the customer selects the option as "Store Pick-up", there will not be any Shipping applied on that product i.e. there will be Free Shipping.

And the customer can visit the seller's store on the given Store Pickup address to collect the ordered product.

If the seller has set the option as "Store Pick-up Only" on his/her panel then the frontend view will be like this as shown in below screenshot.

Now Once the order is placed by the customer and the customer has selected the option to pick up the order then both admin and seller can view the details in Order Listing section of their panel.

**Admin Panel**

In this way, you can provide the option to pickup the ordered product to your customers using this feature app.

This is all about the Store Pickup feature of the [Multivendor Marketplace](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-new-theme-launched/) app for Shopify.

### Allow Store Pick Up on Cart

**SPLIT CART+ STORE PICKUP**

The Split Cart feature app is now compatible with the Store Pickup feature app.

You can use this feature with the split cart. This means that you can now display the store pickup & delivery option on the cart page(split vendor-wise).

Just **enable the Store Pickup on cart** and let customers choose an address to pick up the item on the cart page.

![Screenshot-88](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-88-1200x617.png)

**MARK**:- In case you enable this option “Allow Store Pickup on Cart” for your sellers, your sellers need to configure the store pickup option for **“ALL PRODUCTS”** 

from the Split cart configuration menu of their seller panel as shown in the below screenshot:

![all products](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Screenshot-2020-05-19T145738.130-1200x482.png)

Once you enable this feature for the first time, you will be asked to back up your files to avoid any data loss.

![Configuration-Admin-4-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Configuration-Admin-4-1-1200x627.png)

**Note**:- Make sure both the feature apps (Store Pickup & Split Cart) are enabled.

Thus, the inventory will be managed from the selected location.

In case the quantity is not available on the customer’s selected location then, he/she will not be able to proceed to checkout. And this will show an error something like this:

### Store Pick Up & Address Detail for Customer
