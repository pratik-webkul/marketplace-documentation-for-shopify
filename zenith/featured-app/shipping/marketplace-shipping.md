### **Introduction**

**[Multi-vendor Marketplace](/zenith/introduction/)** app now comes with a new simplified way to understand marketplace shipping in the app.

Below guidance will help you to know exactly how shipping works in the app & how the shipping rates will be applied at the checkout. So, Let's proceed to explore.

### **Why Shipping Feature App?**

As we know by default, the shipping rates are set by the admin on his/her Shopify store which is shown to the customers on the checkout page and the admin can set for seller products also.

But if you want your sellers to add their own shipping rates of their products then we have a featured app named **Shipping**.

In the Multi-vendor Marketplace app, Shipping is set in three ways: Country-wise Shipping, Zone wise Shipping & Postcode wise shipping.

### **What to Choose?**

*   If your seller is shipping in different countries with different shipping rates then, you will choose Country-wise shipping.
*   In case, your seller is shipping in different countries with the same shipping rate then, you will choose Zone wise shipping as the same shipping will be applied for all the countries added to a zone.
*   And if your seller wants shipping according to postcode with different shipping rates then, you will choose postcode-wise shipping. To know more about **[postcode-wise shipping](https://webkul.com/blog/postcode-shipping-multi-vendor-marketplace-for-shopify/).**

### **PLEASE NOTE**

1.  The Shipping feature is available in the Pro Plan of Multivendor marketplace app. Also, to make this feature work, you need to have the **“[Real-Time Carrier-Calculated Shipping](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/enabling-shipping-carriers)”.**  
    
2.  The shipping Feature app **only supports a single shipping profile and a single location**.  
    It is **not compatible with multiple shipping profiles** **& also** **with a single shipping profile plus multiple locations**. **[About Shopify Shipping Profiles](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/shipping-profiles)**  
    
3.  **A new Fulfillment API has been implemented in the multivendor marketplace app. Please update your multivendor marketplace app for the order fulfillment functionality to work.**

### Quick Steps

However, first, you need to configure shipping methods for sellers by selecting the Shipping type as Country-wise shipping or Zone wise shipping.

The shipping methods that you have activated & the shipping type that you set on your marketplace will be visible to your sellers on their respective panels.

Accordingly, the sellers will set the country-wise/zone-wise shipping rates on the basis of the **Price** or **Weight** of the product.

#### **Country wise shipping**

*   Sellers will create the shipping ranges
*   Add countries
*   Set the state-wise shipping rates based on the price or weight of the products.

#### **Zone wise shipping**

*   First, Sellers will create the shipping ranges
*   Select the zone (added by the admin).
*   Then Set the zone-wise shipping rates based on the price or weight of the products.

Let's understand the step-by-step process to install the Shipping feature app & how it works on marketplaces in both cases; Country-wise & Zone wise Shipping.

### Workflow

#### **STEP 1: Shipping Feature App Installation.**

#### ADMIN ADDING SHIPPING ZONES

If you select Zone-wise shipping which will let your sellers add zone wise shipping rates then first you need to add zones from your admin panel.

![Configuration-Admin-18](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Configuration-Admin-18-993x1024.png)

![Edit Shipping Zone Admin (1)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Add-Shipping-Zone-Admin-1.png)

These zones will be visible to your sellers and sellers can set shipping rates on this zone.

Now, let’s see how sellers will add their own shipping rates.

### Set Shipping As Default: Admin End

From the S**eller Listing** menu of the app, You can set the **marketplace shipping as a default option** for any of your sellers.

> It is necessary for the sellers to choose a shipping method. Then only shipping rates will be visible to the customers on front end. 
> 
> If the sellers don't want to set the shipping method separately for each product then,
> 
> they can simply set the "Shipping as default" and shipping method will be added automatically to each product of that seller.

Multi-vendor Admin Panel>>Go to **Sellers**\>>**Seller-listing**\>>Select a seller>>Click **Edit**\>>Click **"Set As Default"** from the Action menu of Shipping Methods.

![seller listing](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Edit-Seller-Admin.png)

In the same way, sellers can also set the shipping method as the default option from their respective seller panels. 

### **Export Seller Details for a Specific Shipping Method**

Now, you can easily export seller details associated with a particular shipping method in the Multivendor Marketplace app. Just follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to** the **Configuration** section.
2.  Go to **Shipping Methods** and select the shipping method for which you want to view seller details.
3.  Click on the **three dots (⋮)** next to the selected shipping method and choose **"View Sellers."**
4.  You will now see an option to **Export Sellers**. Click it to download the seller details in a convenient format.

![Shipping methods](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/export-seller-1200x548.webp)

![export details ](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/shipping-methods-1-1200x542.webp)

Seller Panel: Shipping Configuration
------------------------------------

There will be two sub-menus also added to the Configuration menu in the seller panel i.e. **Shipping Configuration** and **Marketplace Shipping**.

![Dashboard-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-6](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dashboard-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-6-1200x597.png)

Shipping methods are configured by the admin and will get listed as same as on the seller side. From here, the seller will proceed to add shipping rates on their own.

This is the case with **SINGLE SHIPPING** selected from the admin end.

![Shipping-Configuration-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-5](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shipping-Configuration-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-5-1200x597.png)

**Note**:- Until & unless the seller will enable the shipping status from the "**Marketplace Shipping**" as shown below

then the seller won't get the Marketplace shipping option in the Shipping configuration.  
Even if you have enabled [Multiple Shipping](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multiple-shipping/) from the admin panel.

![Shipping-Configuration-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-4](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shipping-Configuration-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-4-1200x597.png)

![Marketplace-Shipping-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Marketplace-Shipping-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2-1200x597.png)

### Set Shipping as Default: Seller Panel

Similar to admin, sellers can also set the **marketplace shipping as the default option** from their respective seller panels of the Multi-vendor app.

> It is necessary for the sellers to choose a shipping method. Then only shipping rates will be visible to the customers on front end.
> 
> If a seller don't want to set the shipping method separately for each of his products then, he can simply set the "Shipping as default" as set the shipping rates.
> 
> Thus, the marketplace shipping method will be automatically added to each product of that seller.  

Multi-vendor Seller Panel>>Go to **Configuration**\>>**Shipping Configuration**\>>Click (...)**Action**\>>Click **"Set As Default"** from the Action menu of Shipping Methods.

![seller shipping](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shipping-Configuration-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-4-1.png)

That is how sellers can set **marketplace shipping as the default** shipping method from their respective seller panels of the multi-vendor app. 

Now, let’s see how the seller can set shipping rates separately for country wise or zone wise.

### COUNTRY WISE SHIPPING

If your seller is shipping in different countries with different shipping rates then, he/she has to set country-wise shipping.

For this, first, you need to enable the Marketplace Shipping as Country-wise from the Admin Panel>>**Configurations**\>>**Shipping Methods** menu.

Check the below video of country-wise shipping:

### CASE 1: COUNTRY-WISE SHIPPING+SINGLE SHIPPING

![Screenshot-2020-11-18T130651.301](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18T130651.301-1200x587.png)

#### SELLER END

Go to Configuration >> **Shipping Configuration** menu of the seller panel, the seller will have the marketplace shipping option in the listing.

![Dashboard-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-7](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dashboard-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-7-1200x597.png)

In front of that shipping method, the seller needs to click the **view** button in the **Action** menu.

Clicking on the view button, the seller will see the list of added countries. From here, the seller will get the option to manage shipping ranges & add more countries.

The seller can manage each country’s shipping rates from the **Action** menu just by clicking the **view** button. He/she can anytime disable/delete any country from the list.

![Shipping Configuration Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace (5)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shipping-Configuration-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-5.png)

### How to Manage Shipping Range?

Moreover, Sellers first need to add Shipping ranges and then proceed to add countries to set different shipping rates for each country for all the states.

![Shipping Details Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace (4)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shipping-Details-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-4.png)

Seller adding Shipping ranges
-----------------------------

The seller will click the Add New Range button to set a shipping rate for zone-wise shipping. These rates can be applied to the product's price or the product's weight.

![Range Details Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Range-Details-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

Moreover, the Seller can add upto 8 shipping ranges for a Shipping method.

![Range Details Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace (1)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Range-Details-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1.png)

The shipping Range is now set on the price of the product. Also, the seller can edit/delete the ranges.

![Range Details Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace (2)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Range-Details-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2.png)

Allow seller to add shipping ranges on the basis of distance
------------------------------------------------------------

We have added a feature where admin can allow sellers to add ranges on the bases distance.  
**Note:** This feature will work on with single **country wise shipping**.

**Configuration:** Navigate from admin panel of multivendor app configuration >> Enable MANAGE SHIPPING RANGES BASED ON DISTANCE

![Admin panel configuration, distance wise range](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/admin-panel_distance-config-1200x521.webp)

Once done, you need to add google map api keys.

Refer this how to get google map api keys: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

### Seller Panel configuration for distance wise ranges

Sellers can then add ranges on the basis of distance.

![Seller Panel configuration for distance wise ranges](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/seller-panel-distange-range-1200x509.webp)

### **Flat Shipping Rate in case of Weight-wise shipping**

If the seller selects range as a weight basis then there is an option to give a flat rate shipping to the customer.

This condition works as per the seller's total products, not the whole cart amount.

### **For example:**

if a customer buys products from two sellers, seller A and seller B and both the seller sets different condition amounts.

Seller A set the max price for the flat rate is 1000$ and the shipping rate is 10$.  
  
And, Seller B set the max price for the flat rate is 800$ and the shipping rate is 8$.

Note: IF the condition is met for one seller then it will work as per the condition for that seller but if not then work as marketplace shipping rate for the rest of the seller.

![s5](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/s5-e1651208943602.png)

To enable this there is a configuration that you need to enable first, **Admin Panel > configuration > Market Place Configuration > Flat Rate Shipping.**

![S6](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/S6.png)

for example: if shipping ranges is set as as weight It will calculate shipping cost on the weight basis.

But if customer order value is more than the flat shipping condition amount then it shipping cost will be as per the condition amount.

The seller can view the shipping range details from here:

![Range Details Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace (3)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Range-Details-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-3.png)

Once done, the seller will proceed accordingly to select countries & set different shipping rates for each country & their states based on the price or weight of the product.

![Add Shipping Country Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Add-Shipping-Country-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

All the countries to which the shipping rate is set will be listed in this section (as attached in the screenshot).

The seller can proceed to manage shipping ranges from there & add new countries also.

![Shipping Details Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace (5)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Shipping-Details-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-5.png)

In case the admin has selected Multiple Shipping and enabled the Country-wise shipping.

### **CASE 2:** COUNTRY-WISE SHIPPING+MULTIPLE SHIPPING

![Screenshot-2020-11-18T132459.408](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-18T132459.408-1200x590.png)

A new sub-menu gets added to the seller Configuration menu i.e. **Marketplace Shipping**. From here, you can update the shipping status in case you are using Multiple Shipping.

![Shipping-Configuration-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Shipping-Configuration-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2-1200x597.png)

To manage the shipping status, the seller needs to Go to the seller panel **Configuration**\>>**Marketplace Shipping** sub-menu.

![Dashboard-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-8](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dashboard-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-8-1200x597.png)

For that, first you need to enable the tab from the **Shipping Method** menu of the admin panel. Go to the Configuration>>Shipping Methods>>Click **Configure Shipping**\>>Enable the Option.

![Configuration-Admin-28](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Configuration-Admin-28-1200x597.png)

Now, enable the tab:

![Configuration-Admin-29](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Configuration-Admin-29-1200x597.png)

Enabling this option will allow sellers to configure delivery days from their respective seller panels.

#### Seller Panel Configurations:-

The seller will manage the shipping from the "Shipping Configuration" menu of the seller panel.

To configure the delivery days, the seller needs to click the **view** button of the zone-wise shipping menu.

![Shipping_Configuration_Seller_•_Multivendor_MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Shipping_Configuration_Seller_%E2%80%A2_Multivendor_MarketPlace-1200x497.png)

Then, the seller will get redirected to the "Shipping Method Details" section to manage Zone-wise shipping rates.

![Screenshot-2020-06-03T111745.394](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Screenshot-2020-06-03T111745.394-1200x619.png)

By clicking the **Edit** button (Action menu), the seller will get the option to fill in delivery days.

As soon as, the no of days is entered and this will let customers to know when the products will be delivered to their shipping zones.

![Delivery Days](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Shipping_Details_Seller_%E2%80%A2_Multivendor_MarketPlace-1200x627.png)

On the product page, The delivery days details will be shown to the customers.  
  
To show the details on the product page, it is equally important to add this code to the product template.liquid file.

![Instruction](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Instructions_Admin-1200x627.png)

Finally adding the codes, this is how it appears on the product page of your store:

![Shipping product page](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Cups_Saucers_%E2%80%93_priyadarshni_store10-1200x627.png)

### Free Shipping Over a Certain Amount

In case you want your sellers to provide free shipping over a certain amount then they can set up the shipping ranges on the basis of price as below:

For example, You can set the shipping ranges as 0-$100, $101-200, $201-300, and in the last shipping range, you can put any higher number like $301 to $5000000.

Then, sellers can put up the rates on these shipping ranges for states/countries

like 0-100$ shipping rate is $10.

101-200$ shipping rate is $20.

201-300$ shipping rate is $15.

$301 to $5000000 shipping rate is zero($0)

This way, if any seller's product falls under $301 to $500000000 range then no shipping rates will be applied to that seller's products.

### **Product-wise fixed rate shipping**

The Product-wise fixed rate shipping is applied to a particular product one by one, not applied to all products at once.

Check the below video of the Product-wise fixed rate shipping:

### **Allow sellers to add an additional shipping cost:**

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/sdfss-1200x502.webp)

The three rules operate in the following manner:

#### **1\. Max Shipping cost + Additional cost of remaining products**

In this case, the product with the highest shipping cost will be considered as the base shipping and the additional cost of the remaining products will be added.

In case all the shipping costs are the same, the product with the highest additional cost will be considered base shipping and the additional cost of the remaining products will be calculated.

#### 2\. **Min Shipping Cost + Additional shipping cost of remaining products.**

In this case, the product with the lowest shipping cost will be considered as the base shipping and the additional cost of the remaining products will be added.

In case all the shipping costs are the same, the product with the lowest additional cost will be considered base shipping and the additional cost of the remaining products will be calculated.

#### 3\. Sum of all the Shipping and Additional Costs.

If this is selected then the shipping cost of all the products and the additional cost of all the products will all be added together.

_**Note**\- If there are **multiple sellers** involved in the cart, the same rule will apply per seller, and the total shipping cost will be calculated by adding up the charges from all sellers._

### **Seller-side Setup**

In the Seller panel>>Shipping Methods section, the seller needs to enable "Product-wise Fixed rate Shipping,"

Once enabled, sellers can navigate to the **Add Product** page. they will see an option to add a fixed shipping cost and an additional cost.
