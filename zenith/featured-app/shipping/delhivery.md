[Multi-Vendor Marketplace for Shopify](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-new-theme-launched/) is here with another marketplace shipping feature add-on, i.e., **Delhivery**.

**Delhivery**: Delhivery Private Limited is India's largest B2B & C2C Logistic Courier Service Provider in India.

They provide the fastest Parcel Transportation, Warehousing & more. Using this featured app, merchants can allow vendors to ship their goods via Delhivery and then print the shipping label.

**Charges:** This feature will have an additional charge of **USD 10 per month** over & above your current multivendor marketplace plan.

**Before You Install**: It is mandatory to have **[real-time carrier calculated shipping](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/enabling-shipping-carriers)** within your Shopify store.

This is a requirement defined by Shopify for your store to retrieve shipping rates from third-party sources, such as this shipping app.

This feature app is available only with the Multivendor **Pro** **Plan** ($60/month). Moreover, you need to enable the [**Shipping**](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-shipping/) add-on (free) from the ‘featured apps’ section of the app.
