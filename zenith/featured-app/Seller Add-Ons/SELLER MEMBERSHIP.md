* If disabled, Your sellers will log in directly to their respective seller panels without having a membership.
* Admin can allow sellers to deactivate their membership plan if required.
* He can also set a one-time Setup fee for Sellers for the Plans he creates.

Admin will set the payment methods through which he/she wants the payment from sellers. You can activate any of the payment methods of your choice from the **Payment Details** section.
