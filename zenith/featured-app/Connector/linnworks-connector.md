**Example**: If you set the Price Rule= 10% (decrease) then a product of $100 at Linnworks will be listed for $90 at Shopify Marketplace.

Similarly, a product of $100 at Shopify Marketplace will be listed for $110 at Linnworks.

If you are setting this up after syncing products then click on the checkbox so that the price of previously added products is changed automatically as per the rule set.
