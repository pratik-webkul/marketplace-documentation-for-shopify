[Multivendor Marketplace](/zenith/introduction/overview.html) App for Shopify is here with yet another connector. This time it's for the sellers having stores on Prestashop!

If the sellers register on admin's marketplace have their stores on Prestashop and they want to connect their stores with admin's store then,

this can be achieve using **PrestaShop Connector** Feature App.

With Shopify-Prestashop Connector, You as a Store Owner can allow your sellers to import their products from Prestashop to admin's Shopify store.

To make this feature work, Seller needs to install a **Module** on Prestashop. Both admin & seller can download the Module from Multivendor App.

After installing the module, Products created on PrestaShop will be auto-update on Shopify while the pre-existing products will be imported within the app.

Once the customer orders any imported products on Shopify, the same order will create on Prestashop. And if an order is created on PrestaShop, inventory will be updated on Shopify.

To install this feature app, the admin needs to visit the "Feature App" section and approve the charge of $25 USD in addition to the Multivendor App plan.

### Features

*   Admin can allow his sellers to connect their Prestashop store with admin's Store.
*   Sellers can import the products by Product IDs from their Prestashop store to admin's marketplace
*   Moreover, seller needs to map their Prestashop store's Collection with admin's Store's collection.
*   the seller can easily enable the auto-sync for the new products.
*   Also, Seller can map product type & product tags of Prestashop with admin's Store.
*   When imported product will be ordered on Shopify, the same order will be created on Prestashop.
*   When imported product will be ordered on Prestashop, inventory will updatevon Shopify.
*   Once a product is created at PrestaShop, the same will be updated automatically on Shopify as well.
*   **[Slot Pricing](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-slot-pricing/) is compatible** with this connector. 
*   Both admin & seller can now sync the seller’s products in any state from the “Product Listing” section of their respective panels.

![abc](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Product-Admin-2-1200x597.png)

### Limitations

*   Sellers can import only Standard Products from PrestaShop to Shopify.  
    \-**Simple Product**  
    \-**Product with Combinations**
*   Admin can import a maximum of 250 Products at once from PrestaShop to Shopify.
*   Variations should be less than OR equal to 100.
*   Also, Option name should be less than OR equal to 3.
*   It is mandatory to enable the visibility of the product available for order on PrestaShop.
*   Tax & Discounts **can't be manage** on Orders. Thus, the order amount at PrestaShop may differ from the actual order amount visible to the seller on the Multivendor App.
*   The default currency set on admin's Shopify store and seller's PrestaShop **should be the same**.
*   It is mandatory to enable "Guest Checkout" on PrestaShop as customers purchasing imported products on the store will add as "Guest" on PrestaShop.

**Note:-** Suppose a country (where the seller has to ship the order) is disabled from the Countries section of seller's PrestaShop store.**(International>>Locations>>Countries)**.

Then, in this case, the order will not be placed on PrestaShop if the customer has select the Shipping address of that particular country.

Seller needs to enable the countries again:-

![Instruction](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Instructions-Admin-2.png)

As soon as you install the Shopify-Prestashop feature app, You need to share a **Delivery URL,** **SID** and a **Prestashop Module** with your sellers.

Go to the “Instruction for Marketplace” section of the Multivendor app & get the URL and download the module from there.

PRODUCT DETAIL CONFIGURATION
----------------------------

Now, admin needs to select the PrestaShop connector from the "Connector Configuration" menu of the app. 

Go to Configuration>>Select the Prestashop Connector>>Product Detail Configuration.

Now, he can enable/disable other tabs for this section as well.

![Connector configuration](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot_1708952412908-653x1024.png)

### Image Limiter

The admin has the ability to enable a configuration that restricts the number of product images to a range of 1 to 20.

This ensures that sellers can only synchronize a specific number of images, as defined by the admin.

![screenshot_1688648237530-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screenshot_1688648237530-1-1200x457.png)

This feature allows for better control over the number of images associated with each product, providing a more streamlined and consistent experience for both sellers and customers.

### Sync Customer Details

By enabling this tab, you can sync customer details in order with the seller’s PrestaShop store. Let’s understand this feature with two cases.

**CASE 1: Sync Customer Details tab is ON (enabled):**

Once a customer places an order, the customer will be created on the seller’s PrestaShop store with complete shipping.

Also, the customers will receive an email from the seller’s store regarding the same.

NOTE:- In this case, if you don’t want to send an email to the customer, you can configure a dummy email.

![on](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/onn-1-1200x572.webp)

**CASE 2: Sync Customer Details tab is OFF (disabled):**

In case you disable this tab, you will get three options to choose whether you want to sync the customer’s **shipping address, name,** and **email** or not.

You can configure the settings as per the requirements with Seller’s PrestaShop store or not.

![off](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/off-1-1200x578.webp)

**Note:-** Once the order is created at the admin Shopify store for the connector product then the same order will be created on seller's Prestashop store also.

Even, the admin will get a reference order number like below that will be shown the order section of the seller's Prestashop store.

![reference order number](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/screenshot_from_2022_12_27_12_51_33-4-1200x595.png)

### How the Seller will install the Module on PrestaShop?

Once the admin provides the PrestaShop Module to the sellers, seller can upload the module on PrestaShop and configure its details to make the feature work.

Steps to Upload the Module:

*   Seller will log in to PrestaShop.

This way, a seller can install the module on his/her PrestaShop and configure it following the given instruction.

Sellers will have a new menu named **Connector Price Rule** in the configuration menu of the app.

From here, seller can create price rules based on which seller’s product price will be calculated on merchant’s store.
