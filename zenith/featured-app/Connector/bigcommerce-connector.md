[BigCommerce](https://www.bigcommerce.com/), an eCommerce platform that provides software as a service to retailers is now integrated with the Multi-vendor Marketplace app for Shopify.

This integration will help the marketplace sellers to connect their BigCommerce stores with the admin’s Shopify store.

Using the connector, sellers selling on BigCommerce can auto-sync their products with the admin’s marketplace. Also, the sellers can import their products from BigCommerce to Shopify.

Accordingly, inventory will be managed at both ends once an order is created/updated for the seller’s product at BigCommerce or at Shopify.

You can enable the **BigCommerce Connector** from the “**Feature App**” section of the app.

Check the below video of the BigCommerce Connector feature app:
