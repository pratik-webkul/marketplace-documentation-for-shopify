E-commerce companies can partner with nonprofit organizations or affiliates, such as NGOs and churches, by donating a percentage of earnings through the Affiliate/Referral Seller feature App.

This can be done via fixed profit percentages, donations per product sold, or special campaigns.

Such partnerships not only provide crucial funding for nonprofits but also enhance the e-commerce brand's image, boost customer loyalty, and showcase social responsibility.

Ultimately, they foster a positive community impact while strengthening customer relationships.

We’ll explore how e-commerce businesses can support nonprofit organizations or affiliates, such as churches or NGOs.

This can be done by contributing a portion of their earnings through the Affiliate/Referral Sellers feature in the [**Multivendor Marketplace app**](https://store.webkul.com/Shopify-Multi-Vendor-Marketplace.html).

Enabling this feature allows businesses to easily share a percentage of their revenue with these causes.

Once activated, nonprofit organizations or affiliates will have access to a separate panel where they can track affiliate orders, commissions, and order payments.

To enable this app, go to the Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel, hover over the three dots, and select "Featured Apps." From there, you can search for and activate the Affiliate/Referral Seller app.

Once you activate the featured app, you'll need to approve an additional charge of 10 USD per month.

This fee will be added to the existing Multivendor Marketplace app charges, allowing you to access and use the app's features.

### Admin Panel

Once the app is activated, you can easily configure it by navigating to the "Configuration" menu and then selecting "Affiliate/Referral Configuration."

This feature allows sellers to promote products and earn commissions on sales generated through their referrals, increasing their earning potential and driving more traffic to the platform.
