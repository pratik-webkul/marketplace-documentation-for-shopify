**Product Auction Integration with Multi-vendor Marketplace App for Shopify  
**Keeping product up for auction entices a large number of customers towards that product.

And it is something that every store owner needs to rev up his/her sales in the eCommerce business.

Considering these traits, Webkul has come up with the most awaited feature app named "**Product Auction for Seller**" in [**Multivendor Marketplace**](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-new-theme-launched/) app.

You might have used the [**Product Auction**](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-product-auction/) app on your Shopify Store earlier but this time you will have this featured app available for your marketplace.

Using Multivendor Marketplace **Product Auction for Seller** feature app, You as an admin can enable your sellers to add auction on products and thus, customers will bid on the product of their choice.

Note:- This feature app is free of cost but to use the feature app, you need to install the product auction app on your store i.e. $30 per month over and above your currently Multivendor plan.

Suppose you opt for $60 USD per month plan, then, you will be charged $60+$30=$90 per month.

**NOTE**:- It is mandatory to install the Product Auction App first on your Store to make this Feature App work for your Sellers.

Visit the Feature App section and enable this feature to allow sellers to create auctions on Products.

### Sellers Adding Auction on Products

**SELLER END**

Once the admin enables the "Product Auction for Sellers" feature app, Sellers can start adding auction on products from their respective seller panels.

To do so, Seller needs to visit the **Products** section of the app. Now, from the Action menu, the seller will click on the "**View Auction**" button from the drop-down menu.

![Shopify Multi-vendor Marketplace-Product Auction ](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/auctioncreate.webp)

If the seller has not set auction on this product, he/she will have the **product details** and a button to **Add Auction.**

![Auction list on a product](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/auctionlistonproduct.webp)

Clicking on the "**Add Auction**" button, You will be asked to enter auction details such as Time Duration, Base & Reserve price of the auction and so on. 

While adding auction on any product, Seller needs to enter the following details:

*   **Auction Duration** i.e. Start and End date & time of auction.
*   Add **Base Price** i.e. Price from where the bidding will start.
*   Add **Reserve Price** i.e. Price where your product bidding should be reached.

![Edit Auction](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/addauction.webp)

Seller can also start the auction automatically from this section. Once You fill all the details, you can either click on "**Save**" or "**Save & Start**" button to immediately start auction on that product.

Clicking on the View Auction button, seller can view the complete information related to bids & auction winners.

![Auction details-Seller end](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/auctiondetails.webp)

**Admin can manually remove the auction on products from his/her end from the "Product Auction App".**

In this way, the store owner can allow his/her registered sellers to [add auction on products](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-product-auction-how-to-add-product/) and thus, Your customers can bid on the product of your store.

### Front End

![Place a bid](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Classic-Mug-%E2%80%93-wk-multivendor-auction-demo.png)

Once your sellers add auction on products from the Seller Panel of the Multivendor app, Customers can view the auction running on that product in an auction window visible on the frontend.

Now, customers can bid on the products and become the winner also.

### Add Auction To Global Products

Here comes the Integration of Product Auction & Global Product feature app:-

You can now allow sellers to add auctions to global products of your store.

For this, the seller needs to visit the seller panel>>Go to Global Products section>Select the product and click **Create Auction** in Action menu.

![screenshot-www.qsnapnet.com-2021.07.09-16_20_33](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/createauction.webp)

Further, the "Add Auction" form will remain the same as that of normal products. The seller needs to enter auction details for that global product and start auction.

Similarly, you can also add auction to global products from the admin panel of the Multi-vendor app as shown below:

![screenshot-sp-seller.webkul.com-2021.07.09-16_17_43](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/viewauction.webp)

This is all about the Product Auction for Sellers feature of the Multivendor App.

### RESTRICTIONS FOR SELLER

Now, if the admin wants then he can restrict the seller from using auto payment settings, proxy bidding, & popcorn bidding features.

Even, the admin can restrict the seller to change the duration and price of the auction.

**To restrict sellers for Autopay, proxy bidding, and popcorn bidding.**

As we know, when the seller is adding an auction product from their marketplace seller panel then they can enable AUTO PAY, PROXY BIDDING, and POPCORN BIDDING for auction products.

But if the admin wants then he can restrict the seller to use these three features.

Go to product auction from Shopify store >> Click on "Configuration" >> now, click on three dots >> seller restrictions

![Sameer_Auction_Main-·-Product-Auction-·-Shopify](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Sameer_Auction_Main-%C2%B7-Product-Auction-%C2%B7-Shopify-1200x608.png)

![Screenshot5](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot5.png)

Now suppose, the admin has enabled the "Proxy bidding setting" from here.

![Screenshot7](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot7.png)

  
Then proxy bidding option will not be shown to the seller while creating the auction product from seller panel >> product >> product listing

![Screenshot6](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sellerauctionsetting.webp)

**To restrict sellers to change the duration and price of the auction.**

As we know, when the seller is adding an auction product from their marketplace seller panel then they can enter the time duration and price for their auction product.

But if the admin wants then he can restrict the seller to fill and update the duration and price for auction products.

Then admin can find these options in the "Configuration" section >> now, click on three dots >> seller restrictions.

![Screenshot11](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot11.png)

**Auction Settings Configuration Example**

Once the **admin enables** the following settings from the **Auction Configuration** section and clicks the **Save** button:

#### **Auction Duration Setting**

*   **Default Start Time**: 4 days from the current date/time.
*   **Default End Time**: 4 days after the auction starts.

#### **Pricing Setting**

*   **Base Price**: 100
*   **Reserve Price**: 20,000

These saved values will now act as **default settings** for any new auction created by the sellers from their respective seller panels.

### **Effect on Seller Panel**

When a seller adds an auction on a product:

*   The **start time** and **end time** fields will automatically be pre-filled using the admin-defined values.
*   The **base price** and **reserve price** will also be auto-filled using the values set by the admin (100 and 20,000 respectively).
*   The seller can choose to **keep these values** or **edit** them while creating the auction.

This helps maintain consistency across all auctions and saves time for sellers by pre-filling the most common auction details.

![Screenshot12](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Screenshot12.png)

Then the auction product time and the price will be auto-filled while creating the auction product from seller panel >> product >> product listing.

And the seller can't change this time duration and price.
