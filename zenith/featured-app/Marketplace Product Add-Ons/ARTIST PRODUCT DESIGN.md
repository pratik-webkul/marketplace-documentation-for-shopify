### INTRODUCTION

Till now, the Admin was able to create/allow Sellers on his [Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/classic/Introduction/), but now with the new Multivendor Marketplace feature app, **Artist Product Design**.

Admin can create/add Artists on his store and let them add designs for the products to sell.

If the Admin wants to sell products with designs from different Artists then he can do so by using this featured app.

This app comes at a cost of **$10.00** per month.

### NOTE THESE POINTS

*   Admin can decide whether he wants to create his Multivendor Marketplace only for _Artists_ or for _Sellers_ as well.
*   Admin can't convert the already added Seller into Artists.
*   Two different artists/sellers can't have similar email IDs.
*   Admin can decide whether he wants his Artists to create products or not.
*   Designs by Artists can only be added to normal products.

Otherwise, the Artist's request will be sent to the Admin in an approval pending state; the Artist will receive an email with the Artist/Seller panel link, after the approval).

Artist Adding Product Design:
-----------------------------

Go to: Multivendor Marketplace Artist Panel > Products > Product Design > Add Products Design:

![SELLER PANEL: PRODUCT DESIGN](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apdtrteen.webp)

![ADD PRODUCT DESIGN](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/apdfteen.webp)

The Admin will receive this created product design in an approval pending state. So to add product designs to the products, the Admin needs to enable the product design from Admin Panel.

Go to: Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Products > Product Design > Enable the design:

![ALL ARTIST DESIGNS](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Product-Design-Admin-2.png)

Artists can further edit the name & description of the product design but can't update the product design image or the price

And once the created product design is used or added to a product, it can't be deleted.

Multivendor Marketplace Artist Panel > Products > Product Design

![EDIT PRODUCT DESIGN](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Products-Design-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1-1.png)

Send design for physical verification
-------------------------------------

Now, the artist needs to send the design for physical verification. To do so, he needs to 'edit' the design:

![ARTIST PRODUCT DESIGN: SEND DESIGN](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Edit-Product-Design-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

The artist can also view the packaging slip by clicking on the '**packing slip**'.

![PACKAGE DETAILS](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Edit-Product-Design-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1.png)

Now, the admin needs to verify the design by visiting Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Products > Product Design:

![ARTIST PRODUCT DESIGN](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Product-Design-Admin-1.png)

_Once verified, this procedure is irreversible._

Admin can further view the design by visiting Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Products > Product Design:

![ARTIST PRODUCT DESIGN](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Product-Design-Admin-2-1.png)

![ARTIST PRODUCT DESIGN](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Download-Design-Admin-1.png)

#### Request For Change Initial Replacement Value

Once the admin sends a request to change the initial replacement value, an email will be sent to the artist.

**Note:** Any further conversation regarding the replacement amount should be conducted over your personal email system.

That is, there is no such function given in the marketplace for further conversation.

![ARTIST PRODUCT DESIGN](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Download-Design-Admin.png)

Once a mutual replacement value is decided by the consent of both admin & artist, the admin can go ahead and set the final replacement value.

![FINAL REPLACEMENT VALUE](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Download-Design-Admin-1.png)

Note that, the admin needs to attach proof that shows the approval of the seller regarding the final replacement value.

It can be a file (JPEG, JPG or PDF format). Remember, the maximum size allowed is 3MB.

The artist can view the replacement value by visiting marketplace seller panel > Products > Product Design > Edit:

![CONFIGURATION](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Edit-Product-Design-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2.png)

Admin adding Products with Product Design:
------------------------------------------

Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Products > Product Listing > Add Products:

![Product Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Product-Admin.png)

To add design to a Product, the Admin needs to choose the product type as 'Normal' only

And the Seller email should be of the Artist whose product design needs to be added (only after entering the Artist's email ID, the Admin will get an option to choose the product design):

![Add Product Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Add-Product-Admin.png)

Now, to add the product design, click on the 'Select Design' button, a pop-up will arrive,

Where the Admin needs to enter the first three letters of the product design name to get the design in suggestion, select the design,

Fill all the required fields in the 'add product form' & save the product:

_Mark that the product price is greater than or equal to the product design price._

![Add Product Admin (1)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Add-Product-Admin-1.png)

The added product can be viewed by the Admin from the Products > Product Listing page. Further, the Admin can edit, disable, delete & reassign the product created:

![Product Admin (1)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Product-Admin-1.png)

### Admin Reassigning Products

Admin can reassign the products & after reassigning, the added product design is automatically removed from the product; this has two scenarios:

*   If the Product with product design is reassigned to a Seller, then the product design will be removed (by default) & can't be added to this product as now the product belongs to the Seller & not to the Artist.
*   If the product with product design is reassigned to a different Artist, then, the product design will be removed from the product (by default) & needs to be added again (the new product design that will be added should be of the new assigned artist).

Go to: Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Products > Product Listing > Reassign (as shown in the image above) > Enter the email ID of other Seller/Artist in the pop-up > Reassign:

![Product Admin (2)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Product-Admin-2.png)

### Artist adding Products with Product Design:

*   If the Admin has enabled the ALLOW ARTIST TO ADD PRODUCT option from the Seller Configuration, the Artist will be able to add products.

Go to: Multivendor Marketplace Artist Panel > Products > Product Listing > Add Product:

![Product Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Product-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

Similarly, the Artist needs to fill the 'add product form', where he needs to select the product type as normal and he will get the 'choose artist design' option by default in the form:

_Mark that the product price is greater than or equal to the product design price:_

![Add Product Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Add-Product-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

The created product will be listed in the Products > Product Listing page.

From the same page, the Artist can edit/duplicate/delete the created product:

![Product Seller • Multivendor MarketPlace (1)](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Product-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1.png)

*   If the Admin has disabled the ALLOW ARTIST TO ADD PRODUCT option from the Seller Configuration, the Artist will not be able to add products, he can only view the products from the product listing page.

### Commission Scenario

There are two commission scenarios:

![Artist-Product-Design-Configuration-Admin-4-1200x692-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Artist-Product-Design-Configuration-Admin-4-1200x692-1.png)

Path: Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Configuration > Artist Design Configuration

Scenario 1: The '**Artist Commission**' option is enabled
---------------------------------------------------------

In this case, the Artist will get the amount of the design as mentioned by him while creating the product design whereas the Admin will get the difference between the product design & product price.

_Let's take an example:_

Artist created a _product design_ of $100.

Further, the Admin/Artist created a _product_ & added the above-created _product design_ to it. Marked the product price at $120 (which should be greater than or equal to the product design price).

So, $100 will go to the Artist whereas, $20 will go to the Admin on every order purchase.

**NOTE**: This feature will not work in case of the sales price!

Scenario 2: The '**Artist Commission**' option is disabled
----------------------------------------------------------

The commissions will charge on the basis of the commission set on your marketplace. It can be any global, collection, product, membership or seller commission.
