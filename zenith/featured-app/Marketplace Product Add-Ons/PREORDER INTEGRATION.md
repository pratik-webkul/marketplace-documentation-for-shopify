[PreOrder](https://webkul.com/blog/preorder-strategy-2020-rev-up-your-shopify-store-sales/) is a great approach to determine the product in high demand. You can allow pre-order on your marketplace products and earn even before the product release.

The [Multi-vendor Marketplace app](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/classic/Introduction/) for Shopify is now integrated with the Pre-order Controller App.

Enabling the PreOrder feature app, you can **auto-enable pre-order** for the seller's products soon after the items get out of stock.

Thus, customers can preorder products from your marketplace by paying the preorder amount.

You can set the default preorder quantity for products.

The sellers can further edit the quantity from the seller panel. Also, disable the preorder on products manually while editing the products.

**Note**:- This integration works only in the case of Multi-product Checkout & Automatic PreOrder. Also, the Partial Payment won't work in case of the seller's preorder products.

### Features

*   With the Multi-vendor Marketplace PreOrder Integration, you can enable the "Automatic PreOrder" option for the seller's products.
*   You can set a default pre-order quantity for products.
*   Anytime, you can edit the default pre-order quantity that will be a global setting applicable for all the seller's products on your marketplace.
*   The sellers can too edit the pre-order product quantity while editing the products from the seller panel.
*   Moreover, the sellers can disable pre-order on any specific products manually.
*   The **Pre-Order feature app** is also **compatible** with the [**Slot Pricing Feature App**](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-slot-pricing/).
*   This integration is compatible with the [Split Cart Feature app](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-split-cart) of the Multi-vendor app.

To make this feature work, you need to install the [Pre-Order Controller app](https://apps.shopify.com/pre-order-by-webkul) to your Shopify store. Once done, you can proceed to configure the settings.

### Admin Configuration

For this, Go to the PreOrder Controller App.

![preorder type](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2020-11-05T132359.049-1200x541.png)

Now, once the seller products get out of stock, preorder will be enabled automatically and the quantity you configure here will be allowed for preorder for each seller's products.

**RESTRICT QUANTITIES FOR PREORDER**

### Seller Configuration

On the seller end, the pre-order will be enabled as soon as the seller's products goes out of stock & the pre-order quantities will be default applied to products to be pre-ordered.

Seller's product that goes "out of stock", will be published in your store for preorder. Later, the seller of the product can update the preorder details while editing the product.

The seller needs to log in to the Seller Panel>>Go to Products>>Product Listing>>Click the Edit button of the product having "0" quantity>>proceed to Edit Variant...

![Product-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Product-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1200x597.png)

Now, In the Variant Details section, the seller will get the option to edit variant.

![edit product preorder](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Edit-Product-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2-3-1200x597.png)

Now, the seller will go to the "PreOrder Details" section and edit quantity for preorder as well as no of products accepted for preorder.

**POINT TO BE NOTED**

In case the seller removes the "PreOrder" option from a product in the seller panel, a preorder won't be created automatically for this seller's product.

So, in this case, the admin needs to add a preorder manually to this product.

### Restrict Vendors To Create PreOrder

You can now restrict vendors from creating preorder on products in automatic preorder.

To do this, you need to visit the **PreOrder Configuration** menu of the app and add vendors whom you want to restrict.

To restrict multiple vendors, add comma-separated vendor names in the field.

**NOTE**:- It work with the automatic preorder.

![Screenshot-33](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-33-1200x514.png)

Confirm the process that will stop all running and upcoming preorders of vendors.
