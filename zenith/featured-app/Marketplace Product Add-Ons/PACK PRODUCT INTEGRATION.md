The **[Pack & Combo Product app](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-pack-product-app/)** is now integrated with the [Multi-vendor Marketplace App](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/classic/Introduction/) for Shopify.

Enabling this feature, you can allow sellers to create pack and combo products from their seller panel. You as an admin can also add pack & combo products from your admin panel in the app.

What are Pack & Combo Products?
-------------------------------

**Pack products:-** Pack products are basically a bundle product having two or more items added in just one package for sale.  
There will be only one seller's products in a pack!

You can create the Package by adding two or more than two types of products in the pack.

Thus, the customers can purchase the whole items in just one purchase, accordingly price & quantity will be updated in the app.

**Combo products:-** Combo products are the combination of various products.  
You may have different seller's products in a combo.

While creating a Combo, you can add various products to it and customers will purchase the combo product

by selecting proper variant, size, shipment separately for each product available in that Combo.

**NOTE**:- A pack will have multiple products from only one seller while in a combo, you can have different seller's products.

So, the Multi-vendor Pack Product Integration feature app let you bring in various products together to create packs & combos and have the best upselling method for your marketplace.
