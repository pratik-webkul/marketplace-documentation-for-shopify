### INTRODUCTION

Webkul **introduces the Daily Deals feature** for the **Multivendor Marketplace App for Shopify**.

You might have already **used our Lightning Deals App** for Shopify, where the admin **creates deals** on their products.

Now, we have **integrated the Lightning Deals App** with our popular **Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify**.

With **Multivendor Marketplace – Daily Deals**, the admin can now **grant permission to sellers**, allowing them to **create deals on their own products**.

This serves as a powerful way to **attract customers** and **boost your store’s sales**.

**Note:** The system now **supports deals on digital products** as well.

### Features

*   Sellers will be able to add deals to their products.
*   Admin can set the number of days for which he wants the deals to go on.
*   Store's Admin can also set commissions on Daily Deals products.
*   Daily Deal products can be viewed by the Admin from the lightning deals app in their Shopify store.

### INSTALLATION

To use this feature app, the **admin must first install the Lightning Deals App** for Shopify from the **official Shopify App Store**.

After installing the app, the **admin navigates to the Featured Apps section** from the **Multivendor Marketplace admin panel**. (Refer to the image below.)

From the **Multivendor feature app store**, the admin then **searches for 'Daily Deals'** and **clicks the Enable button** to activate it.

Simply go to _Configuration_ \>> _Product Configuration_:

![Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify by Webkul- Daily Deals](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dashboard-Admin-1.png)

From the Product Configuration page, scroll down to the bottom and there you will find an option to set the number of days after which the daily deal product will be disabled automatically:

![AwesomeScreenshot-Configuration-Admin-2019-07-02-15-07-42](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02095322/AwesomeScreenshot-Configuration-Admin-2019-07-02-15-07-42.png)

* * *

**Enter the number of days** after which the system should **automatically disable products on deal**.

### **Allow Sellers to Choose Deal End Date**

You can now **let your sellers set a custom end date** for their deals. To enable this, simply **turn on the setting** from the **"Product Configuration"** menu in the app.

Follow this path:  
**Multivendor Admin Panel → Configurations → Product Configuration → Enable "Allow Seller to Choose Deal End Date" → Save.**

![choose end date](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Configuration-Admin-3.png)

Enabling this tab will disable the option to enter the Deal Expire Days. Thus, the sellers will have the option to set an end date while adding the deal to a product.

![end date](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Add-Deal-Product-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

Now, Admin can also add a commission on products which the sellers will sell on the deal:

From _multivendor marketplace Admin panel_ >> _Commission_ >> _Daily Deals Commission Settings_:

Furthermore, he needs to enter the percentage value for daily deals commission and click on 'save'.

### Where will the Admin find deals created by the Sellers?

From Lightning Deals app (Admin's Shopify Store backend):

![Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify by Webkul- Daily Deals](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wk-daily-deals-Apps-Shopify-e1552039671733.png)

Admin needs to go to the Lightning Deals section of the app and filter his search for the specific Vendor which he is looking for:

![Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify by Webkul- Daily Deals](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot-from-2019-02-01-10-25-52-1-e1552039709649.png)

After clicking on the _Product Vendor_, _select a value_ i.e., the name of the Vendor from the drop-down suggestions and then click on _Add Filter_ to end your search.

A list of Daily Deals of that particular Vendor will be listed below in the table.

This is all from the Admin's end, let's move on to Seller's end.

### Seller's End:

Sellers need to login to their multivendor marketplace Seller panel. Now to add deals on their products they need to go to the _Products_ >> _Product Listing_:

![Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify by Webkul- Daily Deals](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dashboard-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

On the product listing page, click on the three dots under the Action menu of a particular product and click on '_\+ Add to Deal_':

![Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify by Webkul- Daily Deals](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Product-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

Note: The products on the deal can be filtered by selecting 'Deal Products' from the 'Sort By' menu.

After this you will land on this page:

![Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify by Webkul- Daily Deals](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Add-Deal-Product-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

The **seller selects the product variant** from the drop-down menu, **enters the start date** and the **discounted price**, then **clicks “Save Changes”** to add the product to the deal.

**Point to Note:** The **discounted price must be lower** than the original product price.

To **edit a deal product**, the seller can **follow the steps shown in the image below**.

![Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify by Webkul- Daily Deals](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Product-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1.png)

On this page, Seller can see the details of the product added on the deal. Click on the '_Remove from Deal_' option, Seller can remove that product from the deal.

### FRONTEND VIEW

To make the deals visible on the frontend, Admin needs to configure the frontend settings of the Lightning Deals app.

From _Shopify store > App section > Lightning Deals app_:

Click on _Configure Front_ option on the top right.

Here you can either _auto inject_ the codes to the files or you can also do this _manually_:
