### Custom Options At Variant Level

Here we’ve introduced a new add-on feature that allows you to enable this feature at the variant level.

![trw](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/four-1200x554.webp)

This flexible enhancement ensures better product customisation, offering a seamless shopping experience tailored to individual customer needs.

By enabling this feature you can now allow your sellers to create custom options for any product at the variant level .

**Note :** Once you have shifted from product level to variant level, you cannot move back to custom options on product level.

![sbfdb](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/three-1-1200x550.webp)

We’ve introduced a new feature with two powerful options for managing :

1.  **Delete Custom Option at Product Level**: This option removes all custom options applied at the product level.
2.  **Move Custom Option to Variant Level**: Select this option to transfer all existing custom options from the product level to the variant level .

![select custom option](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/select-option-1200x595.webp)

### Global Custom Options

We’ve introduced a new feature that allows the admin to create **global custom options** for both themselves and their sellers.

This enhancement helps streamline the process of adding product options across the marketplace.  

![Gloabl-custom-option](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/custom-option-gloabl-config-1200x574.webp)

To configure this feature, navigate to **Product Navigation > Global Custom Options** in your admin panel.  

![add-global custom option](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-custom-option-1200x943.webp)

On this page, the admin can easily create and manage predefined custom options that will be available to all sellers.

![select custom option](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/select-custom-options-1200x574.webp)

Sellers will be provided with two choices while managing product options:

**Create Custom Options Manually** – If needed, sellers can also create their own custom options from scratch, giving them full flexibility for unique product requirements

**Use Predefined Custom Options** – Sellers can select from a list of global custom options created by the admin. This ensures consistency and saves time when adding product variations.

![add-new-custom-options](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/add-new-custom-option-1200x573.webp)

Note :   
**This selection is a one-time setup per product. When a seller first adds custom options to a product, they must choose either “Use Predefined Custom Options” or “Create Custom Options Manually.”  
Once a method is selected, it cannot be changed later for that product.  
If the seller wants to switch the option type, they will first need to delete all existing custom options on that product, and only then will they be allowed to choose the other method.**

###   
Restrict Input Type for Custom Options

We’ve introduced a new enhancement in the **Custom Options** feature — **Restrict Input Type for Custom Options**.

![strct](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rstrct-1.webp)

Previously, all input types were available in the _Add Product_ section by default. Now, with this new setting, you can control which input types should be available for selection.

![rstrctt](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/rstrcttoo-1200x611.webp)

Simply tick the input types you want to allow, and only those options will appear when adding a product.

This gives you greater flexibility and ensures sellers or admins can offer only the relevant input types for their products.

###   
Make Custom Options Mandatory

Another useful addition to the **Custom Options** settings is the **Make Custom Options Mandatory** feature.

![mndtry](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mndtry-1200x614.webp)

When this option is enabled, the **Keep the field mandatory for customers** setting in the _Add Product_ page will always remain enabled.

This means you cannot disable it, ensuring that customers must fill in the required custom options before completing their purchase.

![mndtrytoo](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/mndtrytoo-1200x611.webp)

This update is perfect for cases where certain product details or inputs are essential, helping you maintain consistent and accurate order information.

### Custom Option "Input Types"

In the **Custom Option** feature, multiple input types are available. Sellers can select one of these input types to apply to any product variant on their store.

### Text and Text Area as Input type

The **Text** and **Textarea** input types allow customers to enter their own values based on the field's requirements. This feature is ideal for capturing personalized requests or specific demands.

### Example: Customization for a Shirt

*   **Text Input**:  
    _Field Name:_ "Add Initials"  
    _Customer Entry:_ **J.T.**  
    This lets the customer add their initials to be embroidered on the shirt's cuff.
*   **Textarea Input**:  
    _Field Name:_ "Special Instructions"  
    _Customer Entry:_ "Please use dark blue thread for the initials and make the collar size a bit looser."  
    This allows the customer to provide detailed customization instructions.

### Toggle Checkbox as Input type

You can now have the **Toggle Checkbox as an "input type"** for a custom option added to a product.

While adding a custom option to a product, you can enter the field name and choose Toggle Checkbox.

Now, in case you want to charge an additional amount for the custom option, enable the price option, and enter the amount you want to charge in addition to the product price.

Example:-  
Let Suppose, you sell watches on your store. You want to provide a custom option on a product to let customers purchase products with warranties.

In this case, you can add custom options to the product by enabling a Toggle Checkbox.

Now, the customer who wants to purchase the product with a warranty, can enable the checkbox and the warranty amount will be added to the product price at checkout.

You can add custom options while adding/editing products to your store.

Go to Products\>>Add Product/Edit Product>>CUSTOM OPTIONS\>>Enter Field Name, Select TOGGLE CHECKBOX, Enable Price for Custom Option & Enter Amount you want to charge>>Save.

![Edit-Product-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Edit-Product-Admin-1200x597.png)

To reflect this on the front end, you need to add codes provided in the "Instruction for Marketplace" menu in the app.

![Instructions-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Instructions-Admin-1200x597.png)

If you don't find the files, click the **Regenerate** button. In case you need help with the codes, you can drop a mail to support@webkul.com.

After adding the codes, this is how it appears on the front end.

![Metallic-Watches-–-surya-store20](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Metallic-Watches-%E2%80%93-surya-store20-1200x597.png)

To make this feature work with the **[split cart](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-split-cart/)** feature app, make sure to enable the product properties in the split cart configuration.

![Screenshot-2020-09-02T181342.267](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-02T181342.267.png)

### Drop down as Input type

You can now use **Dropdown** as an "input type" for a custom option added to a product. While adding a custom option, enter the field name and choose **Dropdown** from the input type options.

If you want to charge an additional amount for certain choices, enable the **price option** and enter the amount to be added to the product price.

![dropdown](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dropdown-1200x477.webp)

Example :

Let’s say you sell **shirts** on your store. You want to offer customers the option to customize their purchase with **front or back prints**.

In this case, you can add a **Dropdown** custom option with the following values:

*   **Front Print** (+ $5)
*   **Back Print** (+ $7)

Now, when a customer selects a print option from the dropdown, the respective amount will be added to the product price at checkout.

![dropdown-example](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/dropdown-ex-1200x611.webp)

### Multi-select as Input type

The **Multi-Select** input type allows customers to choose **multiple options** from a list of available choices.

This is especially useful for products with multiple customization possibilities, where customers may want to select more than one option.

While adding a **Multi-Select** option to a product, you can:

1.  Enter the **field name** (e.g., “Print Options”).
2.  Add multiple **choices** (e.g., “Front Print,” “Back Print”).
3.  Enable the **price option** for each choice to apply an additional amount based on the customer’s selection.

![multiselect](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/multiselect-1200x500.webp)

Example :

Let’s say you sell **shirts** on your store and offer customization with **front and back prints**. You can create a **Multi-Select** custom option with the following values:

*   **Front Print** (+ $5)
*   **Back Print** (+ $7)

Now, the customer can select one or both print options. The total amount will be calculated based on the selected options and added to the product price at checkout. For example:

*   If the customer selects **Front Print**, the total price will increase by $5.
*   If both **Front Print** and **Back Print** are selected, the product price will increase by $12.

![multi select example](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/multiselect-ex-1200x676.webp)

### Mark Custom Options as Mandatory

Now, you have the option to mark custom options as mandatory, ensuring that customers cannot proceed without providing input or selecting a value.

To make a custom option mandatory, simply check the "Keep the field mandatory for customers" option.

![custom options mandatory](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/customoption-1200x606.webp)

Once saved, the customers will not be able to proceed to the next step without input.

### ALLOW SELLER TO ADD EXPIRY DATE TO CUSTOM OPTIONS.

This new configuration allows you to enable sellers to **add an expiry date to their custom options**.

To enable this feature, navigate to:  
**MVM Admin Panel > Configuration > Custom Option Configuration**,  
and turn ON the toggle for **"Allow Seller to Add Expiry Date to Custom Options."**

![Add Expiry Date to Custom Options.](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ss1-1200x599.webp)

Once enabled, sellers will be able to define an **expiry date for specific custom options** while creating or editing them.

This is especially useful when you want to offer **time-limited customization**.

For example, limited edition engravings, seasonal packaging options, or promotional add-ons that should not be available after a certain date.

**Please note that this configuration is applicable only for the "Multiselect Checkbox" Input Type**

![Multiselect Checkbox](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ss2-1200x585.webp)

This setting gives more control to sellers over how and until when their custom options should be visible to customers.

### ALLOW SELLER TO ADD SELECT ALL OPTION TO MULTI-SELECT CUSTOM OPTION.

This configuration allows you to enable sellers to **add a “Select All” option** for multi-select custom options.

To enable this, go to:  
**MVM Admin Panel > Configuration > Custom Option Configuration**,  
and turn ON the toggle for **"Allow Seller to Add Select All Option to Multi-Select Custom Option."**

![ Multi-Select Custom ](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ss3-1200x557.webp)

Once this feature is activated, sellers can provide customers with the ability to **select all available choices at once** within a multi-select custom option.

It improves the customer experience by making selection faster and more convenient when they wish to opt for **all the choices in one go**.

### ALLOW SELLER TO ADD PRE-SELECTED VALUES TO MULTI-SELECT CUSTOM OPTIONS.

This configuration enables sellers to **set default pre-selected values** for multi-select custom options.

![default pre-selected values](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ss4-1200x562.webp)

To enable this, navigate to:  
**MVM Admin Panel > Configuration > Custom Option Configuration**,  
and turn ON the toggle for **"Allow Seller to Add Pre-Selected Values to Multi-Select Custom Options."**

Once enabled, sellers can choose which values should be **pre-selected by default** for customers when they view the product. This is especially useful in scenarios like:

*   Suggesting recommended combinations
*   Highlighting best-selling choices
*   Improving conversions by reducing customer effort

Customers can still manually change the selections, but starting with recommended or popular options already selected makes the buying process **smoother and faster**.

### ALLOW SELLER TO ADD PRICE TO DROPDOWN CUSTOM OPTIONS.

With this configuration, sellers can now **assign prices to dropdown custom options**, enhancing the flexibility of product customization.

To enable this, go to:  
**MVM Admin Panel > Configuration > Custom Option Configuration**,  
and turn ON the toggle for **"Allow Seller to Add Price to Dropdown Custom Options."**

![ Add Price to Dropdown Custom Options.](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ss5-1200x582.webp)

Once this is enabled, sellers will be able to **set additional pricing** for individual options within a dropdown field. This is useful in cases like:

*   Selecting a premium gift wrap
*   Adding an engraving with extra cost
*   Offering size or material upgrades

This feature ensures that sellers can **monetize customizations** directly through dropdowns, providing customers with clearer pricing and more tailored choices during purchase.
