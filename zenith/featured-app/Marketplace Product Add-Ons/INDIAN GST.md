We are here to introduce the basic version of the Indian GST module in [Multivendor Marketplace App](/zenith/introduction/   ) for Shopify

Which enables the seller to declare the product price inclusive of GST along with other taxes.

This Indian GST Add-on will enable the basic manual entry of GST product-wise. All you need to do is to enable this feature from the "feature apps" section of the multivendor app.

Once you enable this feature app, the seller can configure it from the **GST configuration** section.

Now, the seller can add the GST details from his end such as HSN, CGST, SGST values while adding any product.

Once you click on the "Enable" button, you need to agree with the plan and approve the charge

Which will add up $5 per month over and above the monthly plan of your Multivendor Marketplace app.

### How it works?

**SELLER PANEL**

Once you enable this feature, the seller will manage all its functions. Firstly, the seller will have to visit the "GST Configuration" section of the seller panel and enable the required settings.

Here, the seller needs to fill the details to add GST fields on the product page. In order to configure it, he/she needs to enable GST and fill the GST identification number.

![Add Products GST](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Screenshot-71.png)

Once the seller configures this, he can enter all the GST components while adding any product. These GST details include HSN, CGST, SGST values which are needed to be filled.

**INVOICE**

These GST details will be visible in the seller to the customer invoice configuration section of the admin panel.

Dashboard>>Orders>>Invoice Configuration>>All GST component details will be visible once the admin configures the invoice as "Seller to Customer".

The same reflects like this.

### Configure CESS For Seller To Customer Invoice

You will now have an option to configure CESS in Seller To Customer order invoice. For this, you need to visit the admin panel>>**Order**\>>**Invoice Settings** and enable the tab "**Enable CESS in Invoice**".

Once enabled, you will have an option to select states for which you need to enable CESS.

**ON PRODUCT PAGE**

You can also configure CESS on product page while adding/editing any product.

**Note**:- To make the CESS option visible on the product page, make sure that the seller has enabled the GST feature from the seller panel.

Also, make sure you have enabled CESS option from the Invoice Settings.

Now, this is how the CESS appears in the Seller To Customer Invoice:-

In this way, seller can declare his product price inclusive of GST and other taxes.
