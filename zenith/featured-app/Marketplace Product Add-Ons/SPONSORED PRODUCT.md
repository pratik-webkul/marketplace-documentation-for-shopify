*   Then he has to enter the “Stripe Publish Key” and “Stripe Secret Key”.
*   Then he has to choose the Billing Cycle, whether it would be weekly or monthly.
*   He can choose on which day of the week  the weekly/monthly invoice should be generated
*   Admin can choose whether the Minimum Threshold budget should be Global or Page wise.

![Sponsored products configuration](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sponsoredproducts-923x1024.webp)

Admin can also allow sellers to set **product-specific daily budgets** and choose whether it would be Global or page-wise.

If the admin selects page-wise, he can navigate to the Sponsored list and set the page-wise budget.

![page wsie budget](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/pagewisebudget-1200x575.webp)

  
  
If the admin sets it to Global, he can set the threshold budget there only.

![global threshold budget](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/adminpanelglobalbudget-1200x575.webp)

### Seller Panel:

In the Seller Panel, the seller has to add the billing and card details under Sponsor Payment Details.

![Seller Payment Details](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sellercarddetails-1200x575.webp)

After updating payment details, the seller can select a product in the **Product Listing** and set a **sponsorship budget** to enable sponsorship for that specific product.

![Seller daily budget](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/sellerbudget-1.webp)

The budget set by the seller would be treated as a daily spent budget, and it would be product-specific. 

**For example**, if a seller sets a budget of 15 USD for a product, then 15 USD will be charged per day, and the bill will be generated weekly on Fridays.

So, the total amount generated will be 15 \* (number of days). This would work as a recurring charge, and the sponsorship will continue indefinitely unless the seller manually stops it.

For sellers to download their receipts/invoices, they can go to the "Sponsor Order" section in the Seller dashboard. From there, they can view the details on the "Sponsor Order Description" page.

![sponsorship invoice](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/invoice-1200x575.webp)
