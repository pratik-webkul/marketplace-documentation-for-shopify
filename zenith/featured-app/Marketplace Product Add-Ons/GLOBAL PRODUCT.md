We are here to introduce a new feature app of [Multivendor Marketplace](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/classic/Introduction/) for Shopify named **Global Product**. It enables the store owner to create global products that can be sold by multiple sellers.

The seller can view the list of products added by the admin in the global product section of the seller panel.

There, he/she can click any global product and become the seller of that particular product simply by clicking "**sell this product**" button.

Admin can enable this feature app with an additional charge of USD 15 per month. This charge will be over and above the monthly subscription charge of your selected multivendor plan.

The merchant can now **add global products** in **bulk** via **CSV** upload.

**Note**:- You can add custom fields to the global products on your store. **[Know More](https://webkul.com/blog/add-custom-fields-on-multi-vendor-marketplace-for-shopify/#custom-field-for-product)**

**You can also allow sellers to add auctions to global products. [EXPLORE](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-product-auction-integration/#add-auction-to-global-products)**

Check the below video of Global Product:

### **WORKFLOW** 

**INSTALLATION**

This Global Product app will be visible in the "feature apps" section of the Multivendor app.

Just click on the three dots available on the upper right corner of the admin's dashboard. There, you will get "Global Product" in the feature app section.

![Dashboard-Admin-2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Dashboard-Admin-2-1200x627.png)

![global product](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Screenshot-2020-02-04T143953.004.png)

Click on the "**Enable"** button to activate the "Global Product" feature of the Multivendor app.

Once you enable this feature, you will add up USD 15 per month in the monthly charges of the multivendor app plan. Now, if you agree with this plan, you need to approve the charge.

Now, the Global Product menu will appear both on admin as well as seller panel.

### Global Product Configuration

Go to Configurations\>>Visit Global Product Configuration\>>Configure the settings>>Save.

![Global product configuration](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Home-Admin.png)

As soon as you enable the Global Product Feature app, You will get a new menu added in the "Configuration" i.e. Global Product Configuration.

On the redirected page, Merchant will have the following configurations. Let’s dive into each one at a time.

![screencapture-sp-seller-webkul-admin-index-php-2019-06-17-10_45_19](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/screencapture-sp-seller-webkul-admin-index-php-2019-06-17-10_45_19-813x1024.png)

### **Sort By**

Admin can choose whether he wants to display the sellers of the global product on frontend according to the ascending or descending manner depending on the prices they have set.

> Different sellers selling the same global product can set different prices. In other words, sellers can edit the price of the global product once they started selling it.

**Frontend View**

![Global-Product-2-â-demo-store](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Global-Product-2-%E2%80%93-demo-store-1200x597.png)

![Global-Product-2-â-demo-store-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Global-Product-2-%E2%80%93-demo-store-1-1200x597.png)

Now, the customer will be redirected to the seller profile page after clicking on the seller's name

### Toggle visibility of the 'Detail' column in the Global Product widget on the frontend.

Admins can control the visibility of four product variant properties on the frontend: Price, Image, Description, and Quantity.

These properties can be enabled or disabled using four corresponding checkboxes in the configuration settings.

By checking or unchecking the boxes, the admin can choose which details appear on the product page.

![Config](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/config-2-1200x509.webp)

On frontend, it will look like this.

![p](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/global-1.webp)

### **Manage Variants For Global Product**

Using this option, the Admin can add variants to global products. Furthermore, the sellers can sell any particular variant of that global product.

> Earlier, we haven’t provided the functionality to add variants to the global products or to import products with variants as global products but now we have introduced this feature also.

So, to add variants, the admin can simply add a new global product & on the ‘add product’ form, he will get an option to add variants.

![Add-Product-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Add-Product-Admin-1200x597.png)

After the admin adds variants, the seller can choose whichever variant he wants to sell. Multivendor Marketplace Seller Panel > Global Products > Sell Product.

![Global-Product-Seller-â¢-Multivendor-MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Global-Product-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1200x597.png)

Now, on the following page, the seller will have the list of all the added variants which he is not selling in the **Unlisted Variants** section.

![Sell-Global-Products-Seller-â¢-Multivendor-MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sell-Global-Products-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1200x597.png)

Single Variant Selection

![Sell-Global-Products-Seller-â¢-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sell-Global-Products-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1-1200x597.png)

**Multiple Variant Selection**

After clicking on the ‘Sell Variant’ button, the seller will have a pop-up where he can change the price, compare at price, inventory tracking option & quantity of the variant.

![Sell-Global-Products-Seller-â¢-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sell-Global-Products-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2-1200x597.png)

#### **Note**

> If the seller disabled the ‘Track Inventory’ option then the customers can place an order for _n_ number of quantities.
> 
> But if the seller has enabled this option then he needs to provide the number of quantity of that variant. Thus, customers can only buy the product within a given quantity.

Next, the variants which the seller is selling will now list in the **Variants Details section** and rest will remain in the **Unlisted Variants** section.

(The seller can edit(update price/quantity) the variants he is selling anytime.)

![variant details](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sell-Global-Products-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-3-1200x597.png)

Moving on, if the seller doesn’t want to sell a particular variant of the product anymore then he can unlist the variants from the **Variants Details** Section anytime.

#### **Note**

> To unlist the variants from the **Variants Details** section, the seller needs to have at least one variant other than the one he wants to unlist.

![unlist variant](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Sell-Global-Products-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-4-1200x597.png)

Now, if the seller wants to stop selling that particular global product then instead of unlisted the variants, he needs to unlist the whole product from

Multivendor Seller Panel > Global Products > Unlist

![Global-Product-Seller-â¢-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Global-Product-Seller-%E2%80%A2-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1-1200x597.png)

#### Global Product Variants: Frontend View

### Allow Sellers To Manage Global Product Price

Upon enabling this configuration, you will get the option to enable/disable the configuration "Seller can sell only global product"

Enabling this configuration the Admin can make it mandatory for the Shopify connector sellers to sell only global products.

### Sync Seller Country to Shopify Product Metafield

We’ve introduced a new configuration in the **Global Product** feature of the Multivendor Marketplace app.

When "Sync Seller Country to Shopify Product Metafield" is enabled, the seller's country is automatically added to the metafield wk\_origin\_country.seller\_country whenever they list a product for sale.

### **Unlink the seller page from the global product**

Admins can now unlink seller profiles from global products. This gives them greater control over managing seller information across the platform.  
  
To configure this Admin needs to navigate to:

**Admin Dashboard>>Configuration>>Global Product Configuration>>Add Seller Profile link on Global Product widget**

![Unlink seller profile](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/unlinksellerprofileglobal-1200x571.webp)

Once disabled, the seller profile will no longer be linked to the Global Product widget

### Seller Panel

Shopify connector sellers will import the products from their shopify store. Products imported will only be approved once they are mapped with the Admin's global product.

**Note: Seller global product will only be mapped with admin product if SKU and option value are the same.**

### Fetch Global products sold by all the Sellers

We have introduced the Global Product API, which allows you to fetch global products for any seller on our platform.

This public API enables you to retrieve information about global products sold by sellers on the Multivendor Marketplace.

    ​/api​/v2​/public​/global-product.json

Through this API you can get a list of all sellers who sell global products,

for a specific product or variant and retrieve detailed information about global products, including price, availability, etc.

Below is a sample of how you can utilize this API in your code to fetch this information and display it according to your preferences:  
```API
    {% capture currencyString %}{{ shop.money_format }}{% endcapture %}
    {% assign tempArray = currencyString | split: '{' %}
    {% assign currencySymbol = tempArray.first %}
