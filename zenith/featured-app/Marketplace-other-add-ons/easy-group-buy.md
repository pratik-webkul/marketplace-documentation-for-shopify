The [Easy Group Buy app](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-group-buy-app-documentaion/) is now integrated with the [Multi-vendor Marketplace App](/zenith/introduction/overview.html) for Shopify.

Enabling this feature app, you can allow the customer to create a group or join the existing groups to purchase the products at a discounted price.

**Features:**

*   This app allows sellers to add “group buy” products to the app.
*   They need to enter a discount percentage, Minimum member limit per group, and group product validity.
*   Customers can create private groups and invite other customers to join the groups to purchase products at discounted prices.
*   Sellers can also allow customers to create a public group i.e. anyone can join the group.
*   Offering Group buying can reduce cart abandonment and increase conversion rates.
*   Increase average order value, as buyers save more when they buy more in a single checkout.
