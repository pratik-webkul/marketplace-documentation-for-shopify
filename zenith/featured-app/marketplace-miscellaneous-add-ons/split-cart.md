Multivendor Marketplace module has come up with a feature app named **Split Cart.** It helps your buyers to have split carts during the checkout process.

This means that when the buyers will add multiple seller's products to their cart, their cart will get split vendor-wise i.e. each cart will have a separate seller's products.

Thus, buyers will have different products from various sellers in their cart but only one cart having single seller's products will be validated at a time during checkout.

With this feature, the admin will have an easily manageable order process and thus, can have the separate orders of each seller's products.

You can get the Split Cart feature app simply by paying an amount of $14 per month over and above your current multivendor plan.

In case the quantity is not available on the customer's selected location then, he/she will not be able to proceed to checkout. And this will show an error something like this:

This is all about the **Split Cart+ Store Pickup f**eature.

### Split Cart with Minimum Purchase Quantity

The split cart feature is now compatible with the minimum purchase quantity feature in the app.

Thus, you can set the minimum quantity on products that a customer needs to buy/order to make the purchase successful.

In order to display this, you need to add the below-given code to the **wk\_cart.liquid** template file:-
```liquid
     <span {% if item.product.tags contains 'wk_slot' and customer != empty and customer.tags contains 'VIP' or customer.tags contains 'Gold' or customer.tags contains 'VVIP'%} id='qty_{{item.variant_id}}'{% endif %} >  <!--Your existing input field --> </span> 
```
After adding the codes, this will be the visibility of the cart page:-

![cart page](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-85-2-1200x427.png)

The customer will be able to proceed to checkout only if the product quantity value satisfies.

### Minimum Purchase Amount with Split Cart

The split cart feature is now compatible with the minimum purchase amount on order feature in the app.

So, using the split cart feature app, you can now restrict customer’s purchases by setting up a minimum order value.

**Case 1:** If the cart amount is less than the Minimum Purchase Amount even for a single seller whose products are added to the shopping cart.  
**FAILED TO CHECK OUT**
