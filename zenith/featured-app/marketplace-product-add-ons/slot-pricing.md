Isn’t it a great idea to **set different product prices for different customers** on your eCommerce store?

With that goal in mind, the **Multivendor Marketplace App for Shopify introduces the Slot Pricing feature app**.

Using **Slot Pricing**, you—as the store owner—can **allow your sellers to define different product prices for different customers** based on **Customer Tags**.

The **admin adds various tags** in the app, which are **assigned to customers from the store backend**, and then **creates pricing slots** accordingly.

To do this, the admin **sets a quantity range** and **adds a price for each range** while adding or editing any product.

This setup ensures **different product pricing for different customer groups**.

To install this app on your marketplace, you must first **enable it from the "Feature Apps" section**.

**Note:** You’ll need to **agree to an additional charge of $10 USD/month**, over and above your existing Multivendor plan.

**NOTE:- Slot Pricing Feature App works only with Normal Products**.

**Important Point to be Noted: Merchants can find the compatibility issues in slot pricing feature app with other available feature apps of Marketplace.**

Let's Proceed to understand this Feature App.

 Features
------------------
*   Both admin and sellers can add different product prices for different customers on the basis of Customer Tags.
*   Admin can add Slot Tags in the app that are assigned to the customers from Store backend.
*   Based on these Customers Tags, Sellers can add different prices to the same product for different customers.
*   While adding/editing any product, admin/sellers can set quantity ranges and add price per quantity to add multiple slots for each tag.
*   Admin can configure the labels within the app also.
*   The **Slot Pricing feature** is now compatible with the [Split Cart feature app](/zenith/featured-app/marketplace-miscellaneous-add-ons/split-cart).
*   Moreover, the **Slot Pricing is now compatible** with all the connectors.   
    

Magento Connector, PrestaShop Connector, WooCommerce Connector, Etsy Connector.

 Limitations
------------------
There are certain limitations that should be kept in mind while using this Feature App:

*   **Maximum 5 Tags** can be added at a time.
*   You can add **up to 5 ranges** for a single Tag.
*   Each customer can view the "Slot Price" **based on only 1 Tag** shown in alphabetic order.
*   The default product price should be greater than the Price per quantity that you add to make slots for each Tag.
*   With the slot pricing feature app, the **customers won't be able to use the discount codes** on the checkout page as the slot price itself is managed as a discount from the backend.

 How to Install?

![Approve Charges](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Demo-Store-Approve-fees-Shopify-1.png)

Once You agree with the feature app charge, you need to approve this charge and thus get this app on your marketplace.

In this way, you can install this feature app.

 Workflow
----------------
![Dashboard](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingthree.webp)

**ADMIN END  
**Once you **enable this feature app**, the system **adds a sub-menu** called **“Slot Pricing Configuration”** under the **"Configuration"** menu of the app.

In this section, you can **enable the "Slot Pricing Structure"** to activate the feature for your customers.

The **admin can add customer tags** that are already **assigned to customers from the store backend**. Additionally, the admin can **configure the labels** used in this feature app.

![AwesomeScreenshot-Slot-Pricing-Configuration-Admin-2019-07-18-17-07-42](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingfour.webp)

Once enabled, the admin can add Slot Tags from this section.

 **Note:-** Maximum 5 Tags can be added at a time.

![Slot Pricing1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingfive.webp)

Once the admin set this configuration on his/her end, both admin and seller can now add different product prices for different customers on the basis of Customer tags.

![Slot Pricing12](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingsix.webp)

Admin can anytime delete the tags if required. Just click on the "Delete" button and disable the "Slot Pricing Structure" tab.

![Slot Pricing13](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingseven.webp)

When you **disable this tab**, the system **prompts you to delete all existing slot details**.

Once you **agree to the condition** and **click the Save button**, the system **automatically deletes all slot-related data**.

**Important Note:** When you **update any tag**, the system **generates updated code snippets** in the **"Instructions for Marketplace"** section of this feature app.

To **ensure the feature works properly on the storefront**, you must **re-paste the updated code into the relevant Liquid files**.

 Remove Slots for Sellers
---------------------
By disabling this option, there is no need to choose quantity range. Just give a fixed price for _n_ number of quantity based on customer tags.

![AwesomeScreenshot-Slot-Pricing-Configuration-Admin-2019-07-18-17-07-44](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingeight.webp)

Now, when a **seller marks a product as “Slot Pricing”** from the **Seller Panel → Product → Edit**,  
the system **only shows the option to select a slot tag and enter the Price Per Quantity**.

It **does not prompt the seller to add prices based on product quantity**.

![AwesomeScreenshot-Edit-Variant-Seller-Multivendor-MarketPlace-2019-07-18-15-07-62](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingnine.webp)

Similarly, on frontend (Product Description Page) the slot price listing table will not be visible. The Shopify product price will be updated to the fixed price set by the Admin.

**Frontend View:**

![AwesomeScreenshot-Choco-Truffle-multivendor-slot-pricing-2019-07-18-14-07-40](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/18091742/AwesomeScreenshot-Choco-Truffle-multivendor-slot-pricing-2019-07-18-14-07-40.png)

**Code Pasting**

To **display the product price based on the customer tag on the storefront**, you need to **paste a specific code snippet** into your theme files.

To get the code, **go to:**  
**Admin Panel → Configuration → Instruction for Marketplace → Slot Pricing section**  
Look for the heading: **“Display product price on product description page.”**

**Copy the provided code** and **paste it into your theme’s `product.liquid` template**  
(or `product-template.liquid` or `product-price.liquid` snippet, if those exist),  
**right at the end of the form tag**.
```liquid
{% if product.tags contains 'wk\_slot' and customer != empty and customer.tags contains 'VIP' or customer.tags contains 'Gold' or customer.tags contains 'VVIP'%} <div class="wk-product-price"><span id="wk-slot-price">{{ product.selected\_or\_first\_available\_variant.price | money }}</span></div>{% else %}<!-- Your existing product price block-->{% endif %}
```
![AwesomeScreenshot-Instructions-Admin-2019-07-18-15-07-89](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingten.webp)

Now, Let's see how Sellers add multiple Prices on Single Product on the basis of Customer Tags.

 Sellers Adding Slots
--------------------
Once you **enable this functionality** in the app,  
**sellers registered on your marketplace** will **see the option to "Mark the Product as Slot Pricing"** in the **Product section** of their seller panel.

While **adding or editing a product**, the seller must **enable this option** to start creating slots.

The seller then **selects a Slot Tag** (added by the admin via the Configuration menu) from the drop-down,  
**defines a product quantity range**, and **sets the price** for that range to create a slot.

This way, sellers can **create multiple slots** for different tags, assigning **varied pricing to a single product**.

![Slot Pricing115](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingeleven.webp)

The Process is as simple as this:

Multivendor **Seller Panel**\>>**Products**\>>**Product** **Listing** >>Click on **Add/Edit Product**\>>"Mark the Product as Slot Pricing">>Select **Tags**\>>**Create Slots** (by entering quantity ranges & price)>>Click on **Add** **Slot**.

In this way, Pricing slots will be added by the sellers using this feature app.

 Admin Adding Slots
--------------------
![Slot Pricing14](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingtwelve.webp)

Similarly, admin can add Pricing Slots while adding or editing any product. 

![Slot Pricing1 edit](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingthirteen.webp)

In the Variant detail section, Click on "Edit" button from Action menu.

![Add Slots](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Edit-Variant-Admin.png)

From this section, the **admin can create multiple pricing slots for different tags**.

In this way, the admin **assigns varied pricing structures** for different customer groups.

Once the **admin or seller adds pricing slots based on tags**, each customer will **see a different price** on the product page depending on the **first tag assigned to them**.

However, to **make this functionality work on your store**, you must **paste specific code snippets into the Liquid files**.

To get these codes, **visit the “Instruction for Marketplace” section** of the app.

 Configure Front End
----------------------
You can make this feature work on your store by pasting the following codes into the liquid file.

Follow the below-given Procedure:

Multivendor **Admin Panel**\>>**Configuration**\>>**Instruction for Marketplace**\>>Scroll down to get the **Instructions about Slot Pricing feature** apps>>**Copy** the codes and **Paste** it into respective template files.

![instruction](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingten.webp)

![Copy the code](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingfifteen.webp)

**Please Note:** Whenever you **update the Slot Tags** from the **Multivendor Configuration menu**, the system **automatically updates the corresponding codes** in the **“Instruction for Marketplace”** section.

Therefore, you must **replace the previously pasted code** in your theme’s Liquid files with the **newly updated code** from the store backend to ensure the feature continues to work correctly.

 Front End View
-----------------
![Frontend](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/test44-–-Demo-Store.png)

Once You display the Slot Price Listing on Product Description Page, the same will be visible like this on Frontend as shown in the below screenshot:

![Cart](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Your-Shopping-Cart-–-Demo-Store.png)

Also by pasting the codes into the liquid file,

You can update the Product Quantity, Product Price, Total Price and Subtotal Price of the Product on Cart Page to show different Product Price to different Customers as shown in below screenshot:

In this way, the admin can receive a different amount from different customers purchasing the same product.

 Minimum Purchase Amount for Orders
-----------------------
With this feature, You can allow your sellers to set a minimum purchase amount on orders. You can restrict purchases for some specific customers based on the tags assigned to them.

Once done, the customer will proceed to checkout only when the cart amount is greater than or equal to the minimum purchase amount set by the seller.

You as an admin need to enable this tab from the **General** **Configuration** menu of the app.

![Configuration-Admin-2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingseventeen.webp)

As soon as you enable the "**Minimum Purchase Amount**" tab, the same will reflect on the seller side.

#### SELLER PANEL-GENERAL CONFIGURATION

From the General Configuration menu of the Seller panel, the seller can set a minimum amount for the specific tag customers required for purchasing products.

![General-Configuration-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingeighteen.webp)

#### Configure Front End

In order to display the checkout conditions on the Cart page, you need to add the codes to the suggested liquid files (as shown in the screenshot).

*   Go to Multi-vendor Admin Panel.
*   Visit the Configuration menu.
*   Select Instruction for Marketplace.
*   Now, scroll down to get the codes for "Seller's Minimum Purchase Amount for Orders".
*   Copy the code from there & add it to the instructed liquid files.

![Instructions-Admin-2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingnineteen.webp)

Once You add the codes to their respective liquid files, the same will be visible on the store's front end.

Order Amount< Minimum Purchase Amount--Check Out condition Failed as shown in the screenshot:

![Your-Shopping-Cart-–-Demo-Shop-2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Your-Shopping-Cart-–-Demo-Shop-2-1135x1024.png)

Order Amount> Minimum Purchase Amount--Check Out condition passed as shown in the screenshot:

![Your-Shopping-Cart-–-Demo-Shop-1-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Your-Shopping-Cart-–-Demo-Shop-1-1-1135x1024.png)

This way, the customer's cart amount will be validated on each order based on the minimum purchase amount set by the seller on the basis of customer tags.

[**Know More about the Minimum Purchase Amount Feature**](/zenith/configuration/minimum-purchase-amount)

#### Add Tag in Customer's Sign Up Form

Additionally, You can allow your customers to select a tag at the time of registration (sign up to have an account on the admin's store).

Based on these tags, the minimum purchase amount will be validated on the cart page for the customer's order. Later on, the admin or seller can change the customer tag from the app.

For this, You need to add a code to **customers/register.liquid** template file (inside form) as shown in the below screenshots.

![Instructions-Admin-1-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingtwenty.webp)

Multi-vendor Admin Panel>>Configuration>>Visit Instruction for Marketplace>>Scroll down to get the codes for Slot Pricing>>Copy the code from there & add it to the instructed liquid files.

Once the codes are added, the same will reflect on the store's front end in the customer's signup form.

![Create-Account-–-Demo-Shop](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Create-Account-–-Demo-Shop-1200x1003.png)

Now, the order amount for each customer will be validated based on the minimum purchase amount you set for each customer tag.

If the checkout condition satisfies, the customer can proceed to check out else, he/she either needs to increase the product quantity or add other products to the cart.

 Tax Exempt
---------------
 You can now exempt customers for paying tax based on the tags assigned to them i.e. You can enable/disable the Tax Exempt option for the customer based on the tag(s).

If the admin exempts the tax on customer tag then the customers don’t need to pay any tax.

Visit the **Slot Pricing Configuration** & enable/disable the option for each tag added.

![slot pricing](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingtwentyone.webp)

 Set a Minimum Purchase Quantity for Each Slot per Product
---------------------------
You can now set a minimum purchase quantity for each slot tag added per product. Thus, you can restrict specific tag customers to purchase a minimum quantity of goods on your store.

For this, first, you need to **enable the Minimum Purchase Quantity tab** from the **Product Configuration** menu of the app.

![Configuration-Admin-5](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingtwentytwo.webp)

**SELLERS ADDING MINIMUM PURCHASE QUANTITY PER PRODUCT BASED ON CUSTOMER TAGS**

The seller will first visit the Products>>**Product Listing** section & proceed to **Edit** product.

![Product-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingtwentyfour.webp)

Clicking the edit button, the seller needs to visit the Variant Details section & click **Add Variant**.

![Add-Variant-Seller-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/slotpricingtwentysix.webp)

The front end view:

![screenshot_1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/screenshot_1-1200x623.png)

**NOTE:-** In case there is a customer without a tag or is not login to your store then, in this case, you can hide add to cart & price on the product page.

To hide the "Price" & "Add to Cart" button on the product page, you need to add the below-given code to the product.liquid template file:
```liquid
    {% comment %} check product has the tag of customer or not {% endcomment %}
            {% assign hide_product_price = false %}
            {% assign hide_add_to_cart = false %}
           
            {% if product.tags contains 'wk_slot' %}
                {% if customer != empty %}
                  {% assign cus_selected_tag = customer.tags[0] %}
                  {% if cus_selected_tag == empty %}
                          {% assign hide_product_price = true %}
                        {% assign hide_add_to_cart = true %}
                  {% else %}
                      {% for wk_variant in product.variants %}
                          {% if wk_variant.id == product.selected_or_first_available_variant.id %}
                              {% assign wk_metafields = wk_variant.metafields[cus_selected_tag] %}
                              {% if wk_metafields == empty %}
                                  {% assign hide_product_price = true %}
                                    {% assign hide_add_to_cart = true %}
                              {% endif %}
                          {% endif %}
                      {% endfor %}
                  {% endif %}
                {% else %}
                    {% assign hide_product_price = true %}
                    {% assign hide_add_to_cart = true %}
                {% endif %}
            {% endif %} 
```
Use in product price block like this:
```liquid
    {% if hide_product_price %}style='display:none;'{% endif %}
```
Use in add\_to\_cart or buy now button like this:
```liquid
    {% if hide_add_to_cart %}style='display:none;'{% endif %}
```
**Please Note:-** The code is theme dependent. So, please add it accordingly.

This is how it appears on the front end:
