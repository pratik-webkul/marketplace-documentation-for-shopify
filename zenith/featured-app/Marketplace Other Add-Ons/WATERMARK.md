In the [**Multivendor M**](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/classic/Introduction/)[**arketplace App**](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/classic/Introduction/), we have introduced a feature named "Watermark," using which you can add watermarks to digital files (PDFs and images).

Using the Multivendor Marketplace app, you can convert your store into a fully functioning marketplace.

where multiple sellers register and sell their products globally/locally. Also, you, as an admin, can earn a commission from the seller's earnings.

This feature app will charge you $10 monthly in addition to your current multivendor plan.

### How to Enable Watermark Feature?

To enable the feature app, all you need to do is visit the “**Featured Apps**” section of the admin panel and enable it from there.

### Workflow

### ADMIN END

Once you enable the feature app, a new sub-menu named Watermark Configuration is added to the configuration menu of the app.

Here, the admin needs to enable the "WaterMark For Digital Product" configuration and set up the app.
