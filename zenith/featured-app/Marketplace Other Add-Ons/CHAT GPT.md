### AI-Generated Product Descriptions Generator using Chat GPT Feature App

**Introduction** : We have launched Chat GPT integration with [Multivendor app](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/classic/Introduction/) which allows admin and seller to generate unique descriptions of products using OpenAI API ( which is used in Chat GPT )

> **Important note:** Chat GPT uses OpenAI model Davinci for answers. Currently, OpenAI **does NOT offer an official API for ChatGPT**.
> 
> However, you can use an existing model to get answers that are somewhat similar to the ChatGPT capabilities: Davinci.

Check the below video of Chat GPT feature app for the multivendor marketplace app


### Configuration

In order to use this feature admin needs to navigate from admin panel **click on 3 dots >> feature apps >> Enable Chat GPT**

This will cost you additional 15 USD **Per month** upon your active Multivendor plan.

### Getting an API key for OpenAI

Now admin needs to configure this app. First Navigate from the admin panel **Products >> Chat GPT Configuration**

Now we need to get Chat GPT secret key. To create an OpenAI API key, you will need to have an OpenAI account. Here is the process for creating an OpenAI API key:

*   Go to the OpenAI website and sign up for an account: [https://openai.com/join/](https://openai.com/join/)
*   After you have created an account, log in to your OpenAI account.
*   In the top right corner of the screen, click on your account name and then select “API Keys” from the drop-down menu.

*   On the API Keys page, click the “Create new secret key” button

*   The API key will be displayed on the screen. Make sure to copy the key and store it in a secure location, as **it will not be shown again**. You can also leave this page open for now.

*   Once you have the API you can paste it in Multivendor app and **save**
*   **Temperature**: Adjusts the randomness of the responses generated by the model. Higher temperatures lead to more diverse and unpredictable responses, while lower temperatures result in more conservative and predictable answers.
*   **Number of Token**: Represents the smallest unit of input or output processed by the model. It can be a word, punctuation mark, or any other element in the text sequence.

### Workflow

This feature will work only for new products and **it will not work for existing products.**

Both admin and seller can use this feature at the time of product creation. Click on **Add product button on Product listing page.** Tick **Activate Chat GPT feature**.

Now your product description will depend on your product title keywords. So for example we are using **Addidas Shoes 2023,** it will auto generate description for our product.

If you need some other description then you can add those keywords in your Description and it will generate **Unique Description** Every time.

This is one of the major advantage of **OpenAI** as it generates unique response every-time as per your input.
