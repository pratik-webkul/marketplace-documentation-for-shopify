Using the Locate Your Store feature app. You as an admin can enable your sellers to add their Store location so the customer can locate their store using google Maps.

Now provide your Seller store location to your customers so they can easily find nearby stores & get directions via google Maps using the Seller locator feature app.

  

**Please Note**:- This feature app is free of cost but to use the featured app:

You need to install the [Locate Your Pickup Store](https://webkul.com/blog/locate-your-pickup-store-app-for-shopify/) app on your store i.e. $7 per month over and above your current Multivendor plan.

  
Suppose you opt for $60 USD per month plan, then, you will be charged $60+$7=$67 per month.
