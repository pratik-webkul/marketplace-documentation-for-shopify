[Multi-Vendor Marketplace for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/) is here with another feature app called **Hyperlocal Marketplace.**

Defining Hyperlocal Marketplace:
--------------------------------

In a hyperlocal marketplace, the merchant can restrict their service area to a particular geographical region.

Since the hyperlocal ecosystem is based on the ‘near me’ concept, this makes the delivery of services/goods in a very short span of time.

The hyperlocal marketplace uses the geographical location detector for detecting the current location of the customer.

It further scans the nearest registered service providers (vendors). Therefore, making the services a faster solution in terms of delivery! [Know More](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-hyperlocal-marketplace/).

This was all regarding the backend settings.

### Frontend: Hyperlocal Marketplace

As soon as the customer visits the storefront, he will be asked to enter the delivery location. He can also continue by using the current location Refer:

![hyperlocalmarketplace-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/hyperlocalmarketplace-1-1200x597.png)

Once the customer clicks on 'Find Food', all the sellers delivering in that particular location will be listed like so:

![HYPERLOCAL MARKETPLACE](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/collage-2-1-1.png)

Further, customers can click on any seller they want which will take them to the seller's profile.

All the products they are selling will be listed there & orders can be placed by adding the products to the cart!

![HYPERLOCAL MARKETPLACE](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Seller-Profile-%E2%80%93-hyperlocalmarketplace.png)

Clicking on the 'Direction' button under the seller profile will give you the distance between your location & the seller's location. Refer:

![HYPERLOCAL MARKETPLACE](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/download.png)

**NOTE:**

_Your seller profile page will also be filtered according to the location._

In case the customer doesn't enter any location or no seller is available at the location entered by the customer:

The '**Add to Cart**' & '**Buy Now**' button on the product description page will get automatically disabled.

![HYPERLOCAL MARKETPLACE](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/White-Pasta-Dish-%E2%80%93-hyperlocalmarketplace.png)

The unavailable products will be highlighted in the collection section. Refer:

![Products-–-hyperlocalmarketplace](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Products-%E2%80%93-hyperlocalmarketplace-1200x593.png)

### Hyperlocal with Multiple Shipping

In case you are using the [**Multiple Shipping**](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multiple-shipping/) feature then you will have the following two options while adding shipping methods:

*   **Radius Restriction**: To restrict the radius for the shipping method.
*   **Datepicker**: If you want your customer to add a date on the product page.

![Shipping-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Shipping-Admin-1200x597.png)

When you restrict the radius & enable the datepicker:

![collage-1-](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/collage-1-.png)

Local Shipping will be displayed in case radius is restricted

If you disable the date picker, it will not display. Also, in case you didn't restrict the radius, it will show global shipping methods:

![collage-2-](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/collage-2-.png)

Global Shipping in case radius is not restricted

Search Bar Compatibility with Hyperlocal Feature using Multiple Shipping
------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, when a customer lands on your website & enters his/her location, filtered sellers will be listed based on the geolocation.

But if you want to restrict the customer's Shopify search for products based on the same radius, you can use this feature.

To make the Shopify search bar compatible with hyperlocal, you need to use the [**Multiple Shipping**](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multiple-shipping/) feature. Further, under **Hyperlocal Configuration**, enable this option:

![Customize-Hyperlocal-Configuration-Page-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Customize-Hyperlocal-Configuration-Page-Admin-1200x597.png)

Note: You need to add a code which you will get under Instructions for Marketplace section:

![Screenshot-by-Lightshot](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot-by-Lightshot-1200x396.png)

In case you are using Shopify **Online Store 2.0**, follow the detailed user guide & follow instructions to add the codes:

**https://webkul.com/blog/code-instruction-to-online-store-2-0/#hyperlocal-marketplace-codes**

Now, when you will add/edit product, you will get the following shipping options to choose from:

![Edit-Product-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Edit-Product-Admin-1200x597.png)

*   **Hyperlocal- Global Shipping**: In the case of this, when a search is made, products that are available globally will be listed.
*   **Hyperlocal- Local Shipping**: In this case, when a search is made, products with restricted shipping in regards to the location entered by the customer will be displayed. Only products under that range will be displayed.

This is how the frontend product search bar will look like:

![harshit-store1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/harshit-store1-1200x597.png)

This is how the search results will look like:

![Search-results-3-results-for-image-–-harshit-store1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Search-results-3-results-for-image-%E2%80%93-harshit-store1-1200x597.png)

### Want To Filter Products Instead Of Sellers?

So,this most awaited feature is now live in the app.

All you have to do is, Simply Visit the "Hyperlocal Configuration" from Admin portal of Multivendor app & Select "Product Listing" instead of "Seller Listing".

### Filter products using various filters:

Now, the customers can filter the products using various filters i.e, filter by vendor, category, product type, and product tag.

Also, if you are using the "[store pickup](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-store-pickup/)" or "[Seller time-slot management](https://webkul.com/blog/seller-time-slot-management/)" feature app on your marketplace, customers can filter the products as per store pickup availability and open or closed store.

### DISTANCE & PRICE SORTING

Even, the customer can now search and sort product on the basis of distance and price.

After the customer has entered his location, a page will appear in which there will be four following sorting options under dropdown named "sort by"  

1\. Nearest first - If the customer selects this option from the dropdown, then the customer will see the products list which is nearest to his location.

2\. Farest first - If the customer selects this option from the dropdown, then the customer will see the products list which is farest to his location.

3\. Price (lower first)- If the customer selects this option from the dropdown,

then the customer will see the products list in which first lower price products will be shown then the higher price product.

4\. Price (higher first) - If the customer selects this option from the dropdown,

then the customer will see the products list in which first higher price products will be shown then the lower priced products.

![sorting](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sorting-1200x608.png)

### IMPLEMENT CHANGES BY SELECTING A SPECIFIC THEME:

Now, you can implement the changes done in the hyperlocal configuration to the specific theme as earlier all the configurational changes were used to populate to the live theme only.

Please note: You will only be able to see the changes if required hyperlocal codes are pasted in the selected theme.
