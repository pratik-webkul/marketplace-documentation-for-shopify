You might be using the [Multi-vendor Marketplace app](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/classic/Introduction/) on your Shopify store. Till now, your customers had no option to manage orders on their own once they purchase any seller's products. Keeping this in mind, we have integrated the [Customer Order Management App](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-customer-order-management/) in the Multi-vendor Marketplace App.

Now, you can allow sellers to let their customer's manage orders. Sellers, on the other hand, update the order status from their respective seller panels.

You can enable the **Customer Order Management Configuration** tab from the **COM Configuration** & activate the option for customers to manage orders of their respective seller's products.

Thus, customer can easily raise **RMA** (Return, Cancel or Exchange) request, **invoice** request, request the admin to **change their shipping address**, and **reorder** their previous purchase. Accordingly, the status will be updated in the app.

The app is **FREE** of cost but you have to pay for the integration that will cost you **$15 USD/month** over & above your current Multi-vendor App plan.

### Features
