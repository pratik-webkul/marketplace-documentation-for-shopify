We are here with another feature within [the Multivendor Marketplace App](https://store.webkul.com/Shopify-Multi-Vendor-Marketplace.html) for Shopify called "**Admin Staff**".

It enables the store owner to add members and assign different permissions to them in order to manage activities on admin panel.

Once the charges have been approved, an additional USD 10 per month will be added to your current multivendor plan.

### Features of Admin Staff

Admin can add staff members from his panel.

He can permit him/her to manage admin's account on his behalf.

Additionally, the admin can also deny access to any section of his account as needed.

Admin can see all the activities of the staff in "Admin Staff Activity" section.

He can edit, delete or disable the staff as per his requirement.

Now admin can give access to the staff subcategory wise.

### Activation of this Feature in Admin Staff

### How does this feature work

To add staff members, the admin should initially navigate to the 'Seller' section. Next, they need to click on the 'Add Staff' button within the 'My Staff' menu.

Furthermore, this process enables streamlined management of staff accounts

In this section, the admin can easily add staffs by providing their details and subsequently manage their permissions by granting or denying access as needed.

Additionally, the admin now has the option to select subcategories to assign specific access to staffs members, as shown in the provided image, ensuring more detailed permission management.

Additionally, this feature offers more granular control over staff permissions.

**Note:** For the existing staff member, by default, the subcategory permission of the selected category is already selected or, in other words, is automatically permitted.

When the admin wants to modify access, they must manually update the settings by ticking or unticking the appropriate checkboxes.

Additionally, this process ensures precise control over granted permissions

Furthermore, it is important to carefully verify the selections to ensure accurate access control.

Once the **admin clicks the Save button** after entering all staff details, the system **adds the staff member** successfully.

The newly added staff member **receives an email notification** once the admin grants permission.

The system also **sends login credentials via email**, allowing the staff member to **access the admin’s account**.

As an admin, you can **customize the content of this email** from the **"Mail Configuration"** section.

Once the staff gets all the details via mail, he can manage admin's account on his behalf.

Now admin can change the staffs password by following steps:

Admin>>Sellers>>My Staff>>Three dots>>Edit Staff>>Change Password>>Save

Now, the admin will provide a public URL to his staff from where the staff can login to the admin's account to manage permitted activities.

You can get this public URL for your staff from the "Instruction for Marketplace" menu of the admin panel in the "Configuration" section.

![admin staff](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/admin-staff-1200x627.webp)

Once this URL is entered, a login page for your staff is automatically displayed.

Staff can use his credentials received via mail to get access to the admin's account.

![Staff Login](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Login-Admin-•-Multivendor-MarketPlace.png)

Once the staff logs into this page, they are redirected to the admin panel, where the sections of the admin account permitted by the admin can be managed by the staff member.
