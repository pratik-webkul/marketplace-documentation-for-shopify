The [Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/overview.html) is now integrated with the **SMS Gateway tools**(SMS Alert) for sending automated messages & calls.

Enable the SMS Alert feature app to include this functionality in your marketplace.

**Purpose:** Admin, as well as, vendors will receive an SMS notification/ IVR calls for newly placed orders.

Earlier in the multivendor marketplace, notification of a new order placed by the customer was sent only via email.

**Charges:** This will cost an additional **5 USD** per month over & above your current Multivendor Marketplace plan.

### Enable SMS Alert Feature App

Visit the '**Feature app**' section from your multivendor marketplace admin panel. Now, click on the enable button to install the app.

Once done, you need to accept the payment. Further, you can enable the app successfully.

    Admin needs to enter the contact number registered with the SMS Gateway by visiting **Configuration** > **General Configuration**.  
    Enter the number with country code, starting without ‘**+**’ and ‘**0**’. Moreover, the number should be in international format.  
    Refer:

![Configuration-Admin-3](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Configuration-Admin-3-1200x597.png)

*   In the case of any SMS Gateway:  
    The sellers have to enter their contact number in order to receive messages regarding new orders.  
    
*   For this, sellers need to visit their **multivendor seller panel** > **Profile** > **My Account**. Further, enter the contact number & save. (Enter the number with country code, starting without '**+**' and '**0**'.)
*   Moreover, the number should be in international format.

*   The number of messages will depend on the plan selected by you on your SMS Gateway account.
*   Monthly payment to your SMS Gateway providers on the basis of their plan chosen by you will be separate. That is, it will be over and above the marketplace plan + SMS Alert feature app's monthly charges.
