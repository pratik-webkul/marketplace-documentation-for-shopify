The Payment page displays the selected orders' earnings and the unsettled amount.

**Unsettled Amount:** During the payment process, the admin pays the seller.

Meanwhile, we also display the ‘Unsettled Amount’ to provide a clear breakdown of pending charges.

This unsettled amount includes any refunded amounts or shipping label costs borne by the admin/seller. The system automatically handles these adjustments at the time of payment.

**Seller Payment Method**
--------------------------

Firstly, the admin needs to set up the payment methods for payments to the sellers from the admin panel of the app.

Now, the same payment methods will be available at the seller's end. The seller chooses the payment methods through which they want the admin to pay them.
