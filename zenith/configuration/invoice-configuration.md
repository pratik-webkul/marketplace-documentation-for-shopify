In [Multivendor Marketplace](/zenith/introduction/) App for Shopify, we have introduced Invoice feature which enables both admin and seller to generate an invoice from their respective ends.

**NOTE:** It is mandatory to have a **Multi-Vendor Marketplace PRO plan** to have the invoice feature.

The invoice can be generated in three ways:-

Admin to Seller: Both admin & seller can print this invoice from their respective panels.

Seller to Customer: Seller can generate & print this invoice from his seller panel.

Seller Bulk Invoice: Seller can generate the invoices in bulk from the Order Listing section of his seller panel.

So let's understand its workflow:-

 Invoice configuration
---------------------
Firstly visit the "Invoice Configuration" section of the app and from here admin can configure the order invoices of his/her store.

From this section, you can enter or change the invoice details like Merchant Address, VAT Number, Fax, Date format, and much more.

Admin Panel>> Orders>> Invoice configuration >> Here add or edit the invoice details>>Save.

In addition to it, you can allow your sellers to generate invoices from their respective seller panels as well.

![mv-1](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/invoiceconfigurationfullpage.webp)

 VAT on Commission
-------------------
You can now manage the VAT (tax) calculation on the commission you set in the app.

Simply choose whether you want to include the VAT on the commission or you want to make it exclusive.

You can visit the **Invoice Configuration** menu under the **Configuration** menu to configure the settings.

![mv-2](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vattypes.webp)

**VAT Type:**  
You need to choose whether you want to include or exclude the Tax on the commission.

Let’s understand this with an **example**:-

### **Tax Inclusive Case**:-

Suppose, Product Price is $100.  
Admin’s Commission is 10% i.e $10.

Let’s say Y is the commission in $10 earned by admin and 18% is the VAT

So, now Y + (18% of Y) = 10.  
This comes to 1.18Y=10

So, Y is 8.47.  
The commission is 8.47 in the invoice and the remaining 10- 8.47 = $1.53 is VAT in the invoice.  
This is the maths applied to such tax-inclusive calculations.

### **Tax Exclusive Case**:-

The product Price is $100.  
Admin’s Commission is 10% i.e $10.

Now, suppose you charge 10% VAT on commission i.e. VAT=10% of $10 (commission)

In this case, the admin’s earnings will be $11 ($10 commission + $1 VAT) and the rest amount $89 ($100- $11) will be the seller’s earnings.

This VAT on commission will be visible on the order invoice that you send to your customers.

![mv-3](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mv-3-1200x634.png)

![mv-4](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/mv-4-1200x697.png)

Moreover, a new section is added to the **commission listing** section in the app.

![mv-5](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vatoncommission.webp)

 SELLER-WISE VAT ON COMMISSION
-----------------------
Now, the admin can manage the VAT ON COMMISSION seller wise which means the admin can enable or disable VAT ON COMMISSION for a particular seller.

For this, the admin can enable "ALLOW SELLER-WISE VAT ON COMMISSION" option in the invoice configuration as shown in the below image.

![Edit-Invoice-Configuration-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sellerwisevat.webp)

Then, the admin will see by default enabled "ELIGIBLE FOR VAT ON COMMISSION" option in seller detail which the admin can disable or enable for a particular seller.

![Edit-Seller-Admin](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/eligibleforvat.webp)

Now, if the admin disable "ELIGIBLE FOR VAT ON COMMISSION" option for a particular seller

Then "VAT on commission" will not work for that particular seller in both cases i.e. exclusive and inclusive.

And for that seller, 0 VAT value will be shown in the order invoice and commission listing section.

Note :-

If this seller-wise vat on commission is set up in between then it will be applied to new orders and the old orders will not be affected by seller wise vat on commission set up.

 SET UP COUNTRY-WISE VAT
------------------------
We have introduced a new feature that is **set** **up country-wise vat**. Once you enable the configuration you will find a green button on the top right-hand side.

![mv-6](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/countrywisevat.webp)

After clicking on the green button, you will see an option to select the country and VAT.

![mv-7](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/viewvat.webp)

Here you can select multiple countries and add VAT as per your requirement.

![mv-8](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/addvat.webp)

On the same page, you will get the list of added countries and the VAT, also you can edit and delete via the action button.
