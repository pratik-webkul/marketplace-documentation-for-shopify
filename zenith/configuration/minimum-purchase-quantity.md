**Minimum Purchase Quantity**: We have introduced this new feature in our [MultiVendor Marketplace App](/zenith/introduction/) for Shopify.

 What is the Minimum Purchase Quantity?
-----------------------------------
 It is the **minimum quantity of goods a customer needs to buy/order to make the purchase successful**. If the customer is unable to meet the set requirement, the order can't be placed.

 Need to implement the same?
----------------------------
*    **Increase revenue** by incentivizing your customers to place an order in bulk.
*   Products get sold quickly hence a **great** **inventory turnover**.
*   A minimum purchase quantity helps to ensure that there is **sufficient demand** for your products to start production.

Check the below video of the **Minimum Purchase Quantity**:


Let's have a look at how we can configure the same in our MultiVendor Marketplace App.

 Configuration: Admin Interface
--------------------------------
There are two configurations that need to be done by the admin: Enabling the option & code-pasting.

For this, visit:  
Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Configuration > Products Configuration:

Here, enable the following option: ALLOW SELLERS TO SET MINIMUM PURCHASE QUANTITY PER PRODUCT. Further, you need to choose whether you want to set minimum purchase quantity for a product or for the variant.

Once it's done, let move to code pasting.

For this visit:  
Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Configuration > Instructions for Marketplace

![Minimum Purchase Quantity Code Pasting](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/codeminiqty.webp)

Here, you'll have a code that you need to paste in the **product-template.liquid** file.

How to find the **product-template.liquid** file?

1.  From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store** > **Themes**.
2.  Further, click on **Actions** > **Edit code**.

Search the file name and paste this code. Refer:
```liquid
    <div id="min_purchase_quantity_div" data-productid="{{ product.id }}"></div>
```

**Important Note:**

For this feature to work, you have to enable the **Quantity Selector** for your store theme. The quantity selector shouldn't be drop-down type.

**How to add a quantity selector to product pages?**

*   From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store** > **Themes**.
*   Further, click on **Customize**.
*   Open the **Product Page** from the drop-down menu (refer to the image provided below).
*   You will see the **Product pages** tab in the theme editor, click on that.

 Frontend
---------------------------------
On the product description page, your customers won't be able to reduce the quantity value lesser than the configured. The value can only be increased. Refer:

Moreover, in any case, if the customer adds a lesser quantity than the required value, he won't be able to checkout. The following message will be thrown on the cart page:
