How to add Scopes in google oauth ?
-----------------------------------

To properly authenticate and interact with Google services, you must enable the necessary API scopes. Follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to **Google Auth Platform > Data access**.
2.  Click on **ADD OR REMOVE SCOPES**.
3.  Select the required scope for your application. For example, if your application needs Gmail access, you must enable `https://mail.google.com/`.
4.  Save the changes and refresh the page.

![smtp-scope](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/smtp-scope-1200x483.webp)

These scopes define the permissions that your app needs from the user. Missing or incorrect scopes may lead to authentication issues.

How to Get Client ID and Client Secret ?
----------------------------------------

Here after creating this you will get your **client id** there click on **Done.**

![smtp-oauth-client-id](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/client-id-1200x676.webp)

After clicking **Done**, you’ll receive your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** needed to configure your Google OAuth SMTP. You can copy your Client ID and Client Secret from here .

![oauth-client-secret](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/client-secret-1200x575.webp)

Click on save button to continue .

After setting up your project, go to **OAuth Consent Screen** and configure your app’s audience.

**Select Audience Type**: You have two options:

![smtp-select-audience](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/smtp-select-user-1200x553.webp)

Once you've selected **External**, your app will start in testing mode. To make it accessible to all users, you need to publish it:

Once published, your app will **then** require verification **before it can finally** be used in production.

Go to the **Audience** section in Google Auth Platform.

Locate the **Publishing Status** and click on **Publish App**.

![smtp-publish status](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/smtp-publish-status-1200x520.webp)

After completing the previous steps, you need to create or add a test user to configure your Google OAuth SMTP.

Note : Test mode allows testing with limited users and a shorter refresh token lifetime( 7 Days ) , while production mode requires verification and is intended for public apps with wider user access. 

To do this, click on **OAuth Consent Screen**, then select **Add Test User**. Add the test user from there(You have to enter the same mail here from which you are configuring this SMTP) .

![test user](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/add-user-1200x586.webp)

Now, simply go to your SMTP configuration page, enter the Client ID, Client Secret, and the remaining details, then click “Save” to configure your SMTP.

**NOTE:** When configuring Google OAuth for your SMTP server,

**it is important to note that** any emails sent **prior to** the completion of the configuration **will still** be processed by your previous SMTP host server.

Once you finalize the Google OAuth SMTP configuration, the newly configured Google OAuth SMTP server will send all future emails.
