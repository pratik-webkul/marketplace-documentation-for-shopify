**Commission Types**:-  In [Multivendor Marketplace app for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/) commission is the admin/merchant share from the seller/vendor's total earnings.

Admin can charge any commission(Like Global, seller commission, etc.) in the following 4 ways:-

Fixed Commission: In this type of commission, only a fixed amount will be deducted from the product base price.

Percent Commission: In this type of commission, only a percent amount will be deducted from the product base price.

Fixed + Percent Commission: In this type of commission firstly a fixed amount will be deducted from product base price and then a percent amount will be deducted from the remaining price.

Percent + Fixed Commission: In this type of commission firstly a percent amount will be deducted from the product base price and then a fixed amount will be deducted from the remaining price.

### Fixed Commission Example:-


Suppose Fixed commission :USD 100

Price of seller product :USD 1000

So  Merchant Share: USD 100 and Vendor Share: (USD 1000-USD 100) = USD 900.

### Percent Commission Example:-


Suppose Percent commission: 20%

Price of seller product: USD 1000

So  Merchant Share: (20%\*1000)= USD 200 and Vendor Share: (USD 1000-USD 200) = USD 800.

### Fixed+ Percent Commission Example:-


Fixed commission: USD 100 and Percent commission: USD 20%

Price of seller product: USD 1000

Here Firstly "Fixed  commission"  deduct from product base price= (1000-100) = USD 900 and then percent commission from remaining price=(900-20%\*900)=USD 720

So Vendor Share: USD 720 and Merchant Share: USD 280

### Percent+Fixed Commission Example:-

Suppose Percent commission: USD 20% and Fixed commission: USD 100

Price of seller product: USD 1000

Here Firstly "Percent commission" will deduct from product base price=(1000-20%\*1000)=USD 800 and then fixed commission deduct from remaining price=(800-100) = USD 700

So Vendor Share: USD 700 and Merchant Share: USD 300
