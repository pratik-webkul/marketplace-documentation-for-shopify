###  Commission Overview – Shopify Multivendor Marketplace App

[Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/zenith/introduction/) offers a robust **commission management system**, allowing store owners to earn from every sale made by their sellers.

In a marketplace model, **commissions** are the core of the revenue structure for the admin. They represent the amount earned by the marketplace owner from each transaction made by vendors.

###  What is a Commission?

A **commission** is the percentage or fixed fee that the **admin (store owner)** earns from a seller's product sale. It can be configured in multiple ways based on your business model:

- **Global Commission**
- **Seller-wise Commission**
- **Product-wise Commission**
- **Category/Collection-wise Commission**
- **Variant-wise Commission**

>  Example:  
> If Seller X lists Product A for $100 and the admin sets a 10% commission, then:  
> - Admin earns **$10**  
> - Seller receives **$90**

The app follows this **commission priority hierarchy**:  
`Global Commission < Seller-wise < Category-wise < Product-wise`

###  Global Commission

- Applied to all sellers, products, and collections.
- Set from the **Global Commission Settings** tab in the app.
- Supports both **percentage-based** and **fixed-value** commission.

**Example:**

If commission is set to **10% + $20**, and the total order is $1400:  
- Seller A’s sale: $500 → Admin gets $70 → Seller earns $430  
- Seller B’s sale: $900 → Admin gets $110 → Seller earns $790

###  Seller-wise Commission

You can override the global settings for specific sellers from the **Seller Commission Settings** page in the app.
