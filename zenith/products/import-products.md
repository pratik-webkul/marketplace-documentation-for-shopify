Admin can import products added on his Shopify Store to [Multivendor Marketplace for Shopify](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/zenith/introduction/), after this, the admin needs to assign those products to the sellers.

Now, to make the products appear in the Product menu, you need to assign the imported products to the sellers. Then only, the orders will be created in the Multi-vendor App.

Let's see how the Admin can do this:
------------------------------------

Go to: Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Products > Import Products > Click on the 'Import Products' button:

On the redirected page, the admin will get two different methods to import the products in bulk:

**Method 1:**

Import products by date range; select the FROM & TO dates between which you want the products from your Shopify store to get imported in your Multivendor Marketplace.

Note: You need to choose the date range accordingly while importing products because only those products will be imported which are available under the date range selected by you.

**Method 2:**

Import products via CSV file; the admin can also download a dummy CSV file for reference.

Assign Imported Products to Sellers
-----------------------------------

The imported products will be listed on the following page-

Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Products > Import Products:

Now, the admin needs to click on the three dots (**⋅⋅⋅**) under the ACTION menu & then click on the 'Assign product to seller' button. This action will give you a pop-up:

On this pop-up, the admin can change the product type (normal/global/digital) & then he needs to enter the seller email ID.

**Mark**:  
If the product has variants then admin can't change the product type to Global/Digital while assigning them to the seller.
