With the help of this feature, Admin can edit the product details from the Shopify end and the updated changes reflect automatically on the Marketplace.

Let us check out this feature in detail below:


 Enable the configuration: Admin panel

Now, Let's edit these fields on products from the Shopify end.

Then the updated changes will reflect automatically on the Multi-vendor Marketplace app.

**An Important Point:**

When you'll update the data from shopify then wait for some time to see the updated changes in Multivendor app.

Because the products are added to the queue in the backend for processing.
