Choose the product as digital:

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dg6.webp)

In the **Add Digital Product** section; upload your digital product file (the file should be less than or equal to 100 MBs), enter the number of accessible days for which your customers can access it.

And enter the number of downloads allowed. (By default, the value is equal to zero which means unlimited access & downloading)

Furthermore, in the **Inventory Details** section, mark this option if you have variants for this digital product:

![image](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dg7.webp)

Checking this option will open a **Variant Details** section where you can add variants to this digital product:

**Note**: Variants can also be added after saving the product and while editing it.

The option to upload digital files to individual variants will only be present once you'll save this product and edit it.

As explained above, save the product and then you can upload digital files to individual products:

The added product will be listed in the Multivendor Marketplace Seller/Admin Panel > Products > Product Listing.

### Digital Product As Service

The admin can now have the option to **add digital product as service** in the Multi-vendor App.

In this case, both you & your sellers can directly create & sell digital products without uploading the digital files.

Instead, both can upload digital files after the order is placed for the digital product.

First, the admin needs to enable the configuration.

*   Go to the **Configuration** menu of the app.
*   Visit the **Product Configuration**.
*   Enable the "**ADD DIGITAL PRODUCT AS SERVICE**" tab.

![ADD DIGITAL PRODUCT AS SERVICE](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dg11.webp)

As soon as the admin enabled this tab, the option starts getting reflected in the admin & seller's **Edit Product** sections respectively.

While adding/editing digital products, you can enable the "ADD DIGITAL PRODUCT AS SERVICE" option.

This action will disable the rest of the options (upload file, no of accessible days) for that digital product.

![dsds](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dg12.webp)

As soon as the customer places an order, both admin & seller will get the option to upload a digital file.

App>>**Orders**\>>**Order Listing**\>>**Edit** Order>>**Upload** the digital files.

![ORDER LISTING](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/dg13.webp)

After this, the customer will receive an email regarding the same from where they can download the digital file.

### Digital Product As Link

Add link to your digital products. First, the admin needs to enable the configuration.

*   Go to the **Configuration** menu of the app.
*   Visit the **Product Configuration**.
*   Enable the "**ALLOW TO ADD LINK FOR DIGITAL PRODUCT**" tab.

![bhjh ](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/image-19-1200x597.png)

As soon as the admin enabled this tab, the option starts getting reflected in the admin & seller's **Edit Product** sections respectively.

While adding/editing digital products, you can select the DIGITAL PRODUCT AS LINK option. Further add the link of the product and save.

This way the digital product will not take up your multi vendor digital space. It will be downloaded by the customers from the external link provided by you.

Go to Multivendor Marketplace Admin Panel > Configuration > Instruction for Marketplace:
