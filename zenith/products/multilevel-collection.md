In our [Multivendor Marketplace app for Shopify](https://store.webkul.com/Shopify-Multi-Vendor-Marketplace.html), we have introduced an additional feature name "Multilevel collection"

Which allows the admin to create subcategories of a particular collection for the Product page.

The Multilevel collection setup/parent-child setup will be only for the backend while creating a product or editing any product and not for the front end.

Features:-
----------

*   Admin will be able to manage collections itself at any time (for example - add new collections or remove collections and change the parent and child categories and levels)
*   At the product page when the seller selects the child collection then the child's parent and sub-parent get selected automatically.
*   At the Front end when a customer clicks the parent collection he/she will see all the products which are available under all the child categories under that parent.

So let's understand its workflow:-

### WORKFLOW

To use Multilevel collection while creating the product you firstly need to enable this from the "Restriction Collection" section from the Configuration section of the app.

Admin end>> Configuration>> Restriction Configuration >> Enable"Restrict Collection" >> Enable " Use Multilevel collection for product page" >> Save changes

Now visit the " Collection section" of the "Products" menu in our multivendor marketplace app.

so from here you can add new collections and view the list of existing collections.

To create subcategory/child of a particular collection, click on the "View child's" in action section in front of collection ID

If Seller will select the parent collection then he/she need to manually select its children but when the seller will select the child collection

Then it will automatically select that child's parent and sub-parent.
