The [**Multi-vendor Marketplace app**](https://marketplace-doc.webkul.com/zenith/introduction/) is dedicated to convert your [Shopify store](https://shopify.com/free-trial?ref=webkul) into a fully-functional marketplace.

It is a feature-rich eCommerce solution for every merchant to grow-up their online stores.

You as an admin can register sellers on your marketplace who can showcase their brands worldwide.

Sellers can add items & sell them to your store. You, on the other hand, appreciate commission.

As soon as the sellers get registered to your marketplace, they will have separate seller panels from where they can manage their products.
