Once the Seller clicks on View Booking Details, he/she will be straight away redirected to the Booking Details page.

In case the "Auto-approve" tab is enabled from the Configuration menu, the customer's booking request will get approved automatically.

All you need to do is just go to the **Configuration** menu of the Booking App and **enable** the "**Auto-Approval Booking**" tab.

![b8](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/b8-1200x584.png)

### How to Cancel Bookings?

In the feature app, You can configure two settings for booking cancellation.

You can either allow sellers to cancel customer's booking from their respective seller panels OR You can allow customers to cancel bookings on their own. Let's understand both of them.

**Case 1:- Allow Sellers to Cancel Bookings from the Seller Panel.**

Each time a new booking request arises, the seller can choose if he/she wants to approve or cancel the booking.

In the Bookings section of the seller's "Booking Dashboard", the seller can edit the booking detail to cancel the customer's booking request.

![Cancel Booking](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Edit-Booking-1200x627.png)

The canceled bookings will be visible to sellers in the Bookings listing on the seller dashboard.

![Listings](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Bookings-2-1200x627.png)

Also, in case a customer has requested you to cancel his/her booking on call or mail. You can do it manually in the app.

At the same time, you can inform the seller to cancel the customer's booking from his/her seller panel booking dashboard. Just follow the above steps.

**Case 2:- Allow Customers to Cancel Bookings.**

In case you want customers to cancel their bookings, you can allow them to do so. You just need to configure one setting in the app.

Go to the Booking App>>Visit Configuration>>Enable "Allow Booking Cancellation option to Customers">>Save.

![b9](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/b9-1200x591.png)

This way, customers will get the option to cancel bookings from their respective "My Account" section.

As soon as the customer places an order, he/she can log in to the “**My Account**” section & view the order details to check the bookings.

![Customer Account](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Account-%E2%80%93-Demo-Store-1200x627.png)

Clicking the order ID, click the “**View Booking Details**“.

From here, the customer can check the complete booking details & get the option to **cancel** the booking.

![Booking-Information-–-Demo-Store](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Booking-Information-%E2%80%93-Demo-Store-1200x835.png)

![booking canceled](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-86-1200x517.png)

### Customer End

Customer can view the booking details from their respective "**My Account**" section.

![customer bookings](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Order-1004-–-multivendor-booking-demo.png)

This is all about the Booking Product feature app of the [Multivendor Marketplace](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-new-theme-launched/) app for Shopify.

### Recent Updates

#### **Cart Lock Feature**

You can now set a duration up to which you want to lock the seller's booking products/services in the customer’s shopping carts.

For this, you need to enable the **Allow Cart-Lock** option in the app and set a time to lock the booking products/services in the customer’s shopping cart.

![b10](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/b10-1200x592.png)

**EXAMPLE**

Suppose a customer selects a slot from 11 A.M to 12 P.M to book service & you have locked the shopping cart for 60 minutes (1 hour) in the app.

Then, in this case, the selected slot ( 11 A.M to 12 P.M) for that particular service will be unavailable for the other customers for 1 hour.

This is how it appears on the cart page:

![Cart Page](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screenshot-82-1200x635.png)

#### **Update in Overwrite Specific Days Feature**

You can now close bookings for some specific time duration of a particular date in the **appointment type** as well as **rent type with time** bookings.

Let’s understand it with an example:

Suppose you select a duration from 24th-28th December (5 Days) to close the booking on a product. For that, you add the time duration from 8 A.M- 9 A.M and from 10 A.M – 11 A.M.

So, in this case, the booking on that product gets closed from 8 A.M to 9 A.M and from 10 A.M to 11 A.M on all the 5 Days (24th December to 28th December).

![b11](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/b11-1200x581.png)

#### **Reschedule Requests Listing**

Once the customer requests the admin to reschedule his/her booking, all the requests will be listed in the “Reschedule Requests” section of the app.

From there, the admin will approve the reschedule requests of the customers, if the status is Pending!

![b12](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/b12.png)

#### **Restrict Booking Product Features for Sellers**
