## Rental Marketplace

A **Rental Marketplace** is a service-based marketplace model where sellers offer products or assets on rent for a specific duration instead of selling them permanently. Customers can book rental items by selecting the required dates directly from the marketplace.

Using the **Marketplace app**, marketplace owners can build a multivendor rental marketplace where multiple sellers list their rental products and manage bookings under a single platform.

Rental marketplaces are ideal for businesses that want to monetize products through temporary usage rather than one-time sales.


## Common Use Cases for Rental Marketplaces

A rental marketplace can be used across multiple industries and business models, such as:

- Equipment rental marketplaces  
- Tools and machinery rentals  
- Short-term product rental platforms  
- Asset-sharing marketplaces  

By offering rental options, sellers can reach a wider customer base while customers benefit from flexible and cost-effective access to products.



## Booking Product Featured App for Rental Marketplaces

To enable rental functionality within the marketplace, the **Booking Product** featured app is used. This app integrates seamlessly with the Marketplace app and allows sellers to convert rental items into **bookable products**.

With the Booking Product featured app:

- Sellers can create rental products with date-based availability  
- Customers can select booking start and end dates  
- Product availability is managed automatically  
- Rental bookings are processed through the marketplace checkout  

This ensures a smooth rental booking experience while maintaining consistency with the marketplace order workflow.

## Why Use Booking Product for Rental Marketplaces
