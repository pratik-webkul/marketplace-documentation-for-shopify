Appointment & Booking Marketplace
--------------------------------
An **Appointment & Booking Marketplace** is a service-based marketplace model where sellers offer **time-based services** such as consultations, sessions, or scheduled appointments. Customers can book these services by selecting an available date and time directly from the marketplace.

Using the **Marketplace app**, marketplace owners can create a multivendor environment where multiple service providers can register and offer appointment-based services under a single platform.

This marketplace model is widely used for businesses that rely on scheduled availability rather than physical product delivery.

An appointment-based marketplace is suitable for a wide range of service-driven business models, including:

- Consultation-based services

By enabling booking functionality, customers can easily reserve a service in advance while sellers can manage their schedules efficiently.
