# Seller Policy Configuration in Shopify Multivendor Marketplace

The [Multivendor Marketplace app for Shopify](/zenith/introduction/overview.html) allows merchants and sellers to configure two types of seller policies:

- **Normal Seller Policy**
- **Advanced Seller Policy**

By default, the **Normal Seller Policy** is selected in the app. This provides sellers with a simple text area to add their seller policy, which is then displayed on the seller's profile page.

With the **Advanced Seller Policy** feature, the admin can configure a more detailed seller policy including fields like delivery days, delivery time, delivery method name, and more. Sellers can also manage their policies from the "My Account" section in their profile.

## Workflow
