We have updated the [Multivendor Marketplace app](/zenith/introduction/overview.html) for Shopify and is now available with a new feature of Seller Profile Page.

Each seller will have their respective seller profile page on the admin's Marketplace where all the products of that seller will be displayed itself.

This User Guide will help you to understand how an admin can customize it as per his/her requirements.

All the products of that particular Seller will be displayed on each seller's profile page.

There will be a separate section of reviews given to that seller, policies & description (if added by the seller).

Also, there will be a Feedback section from where customers will give their feedback for the seller's products.

Now, from the **Seller Profile Page Settings** menu, you can customize the seller's profile page by editing/changing the content of the page.

In addition to it, you can change the content position of the profile page, show/hide content, change the theme as well.

If you want the customers to get redirected to the seller's profile page, you have to paste the code in **product.liquid template** file mentioned in the configuration page.

After pasting the code, a seller link will be displayed on the product description page. By clicking the link, you will be straightaway redirected to the seller's profile page.

Admin can also create a menu of Seller Listing Page on his/her store by referring to below-given steps:

*   Visit Shopify Store Backend
*   Click "Online Store"
*   Go to Navigation
*   Click on Main Menu (if Created otherwise Add Menu)
*   Enter Title and Link of Profile Page.
*   Lastly, click on Add & Save the Menu.

This way, you can add a Seller Listing Page menu to your store's frontend.

 SELLER COLLECTION:

Now you can create seller collection pages instead of a seller profile page with all the similar seller information from the: Admin panel >> sellers >> seller profile page settings.

The seller collection page can be created in two ways i.e,

with collections OR without collection.  
With collection: Select this if you want to create collections corresponding to all sellers on the Shopify side.

Without collection: Select this if you want to display the collection pages without creating the collections for all the corresponding sellers on the Shopify side.

> **NOTE: Please check carefully before saving the changes**
> 
> **whether you want to select "with collection" or "Without collection" as once the collections are created selecting "with collection",**
> 
> **you will have to delete the collection manually in case you want to change the seller profile type to "without collections**".
> 
> **Also if Merchant have more than 5000 sellers than we would recommend to not use with collection for Seller profile type.**

![screenshot-akram-sh.webkul.com-2022.03.07-22_16_58](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sdd6.webp)

Please NOTE: On updating the seller profile type, you need to regenerate the seller category page from the "Storefront configuration" section here:

![screenshot-akram-sh.webkul.com-2022.03.07-22_32_41](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/fg67.webp)

Also, please note: If you have a customized seller profile page and you want to change the seller profile type,

you need to make some changes from the **wk-seller-category.liquid** file in your theme instead of regenerating

the page as regenerating the page will vanish the custom work and populate the default seller profile page provided by us.

If you want to change the seller profile type from "with collection" to "without collection" set the value to "0"

If you want to change the seller profile type from "without collection to with collection" set the value to "1"

![screenshot-akram-store2.myshopify.com-2022.03.07-22_55_51](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screenshot-akram-store2.myshopify.com-2022.03.07-22_55_51-1200x581.png)

 Use Store Name & Description as Meta Title and Description for Seller Pages
------------------------------------------
When a seller profile is displayed as a collection page (showing all products from a particular seller),

it's important to ensure that the **meta title and meta description are optimized for search engines**.

To keep it effective and consistent:

*   **Meta Title** should reflect the **seller’s store name**
*   **Meta Description** should use the **seller’s store description**

 How to Set It in Multivendor Marketplace App:
------------------------------
1.  Open the **Multivendor Marketplace** app.
2.  Go to the **“Sellers”** section.
3.  Click on any seller profile to **edit**.
4.  Ensure that the **Store Name** and **Store Description** fields are properly filled.
5.  **Save** the changes.

![meta](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/meta.webp)

![metam](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/metam.webp)

![meta](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/metav.webp)

These values will automatically be used as the meta title and meta description on the seller's collection page.

 CODE IMPLEMENTATION FOR SELLER COLLECTION PAGE:
-----------------------
You need to add these codes for the seller collection pages:

Copy following code into **collection.liquid** template before collection name and banner.  
```liquid
{% section 'wk-seller-category' %} ```

Copy following code into **collection-template.liquid** template and add class inside the collection banner and collection title div.

To hide the collection banner and collection title from the Seller Collection page.  
"wk-collection-profile-hide"

Copy following code into **collection-template.liquid** template and add class inside the parent div for products and filters.

To hide the products when customer switches from one Tab to another( Seller Product , Feedback , Reviews, Policy, Description ).  
"wk-seller-products"

**NOTE: Now, the seller collection is now compatible with Shopify store 2.0.**

![akram](https://cdnblog.webkul.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/akram-1200x564.png)

In the Shopify store 2.0:
