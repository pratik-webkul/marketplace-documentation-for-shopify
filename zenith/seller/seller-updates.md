This Guide is dedicated to letting you aware of all the new updates of the Seller menu of the [Multi-Vendor Marketplace App](https://webkul.com/blog/shopify-multivendor-marketplace-new-theme-launched/) for Shopify. 

Please keep following and tracking the **Seller Updates** to know about all the updates in the app.

Have a look at the newly introduced and updated features of the Seller menu of Multi vendor Marketplace app for Shopify:

### Update Seller Handle

When a new seller gets registered to your marketplace, it creates a seller handle for the particular seller profile page that is same as the seller name.

Suppose your seller name is **"Test Vendor"**, a seller profile page link will be created for that seller with seller handle **"test-vendor"**.

By default, the seller name will be added as seller handle for respective seller.

But, we have provided an option in the app through which you can **update the seller handle for your seller profile page**.

To do this, visit the Multi-vendor admin panel>>Configuration>>Seller Configuration>>Enable the Update Seller Handle tab>>Save.
